Ideas to Improve Your Study of
Preach My Gospel
Preach My Gospel
weaves the scriptures and the principles of the gospel together to help you come to know the Savior and His gospel.
It is intended to help draw you into the scriptures and enrich your study of them.
Study the scripture references in each chapter throughout your mission.
Each chapter in

includes ideas and activities to help you study and apply what you are learning.
Use these in your personal and companion study (see
Missionary Standards
,
2.4
).
You can also use them during district council meetings and zone conferences.
Your study will be more effective when you find ways to apply what you learn.
It is helpful to have a plan for your personal study.
You could create your own plan that gives priority to gospel principles that you would like to understand better.
You could also structure your study around the chapters in
Preach My Gospel
.
For example, you could use the lessons in
chapter 3
to guide your study of the doctrine and principles you will teach.
You need to know these lessons well so you can teach by the Spirit in your own words.
Take notes as you study.
Use a paper or electronic study journal (such as Gospel Library) to help you understand, clarify, and remember what you are learning.
Begin your study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn.
He will bring knowledge, understanding, and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless others.
Open your mind and heart to the impressions and insights you receive from Him.
Include these insights in your notes.
Review your study journal regularly to recall spiritual experiences, see new insights, and recognize your growth.

Chapter 1
Fulfill Your Missionary Purpose
Your Purpose:
Invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
Consider This
What is my purpose as a missionary?
What authority and power come with my calling?
How do I rely on, recognize, and teach by the Spirit?
What is the gospel of Jesus Christ?
What is the message of the Restoration?
Why is it so important?
What is my responsibility to establish and build up the Church of Jesus Christ?
How will I know whether I am a successful missionary?
Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ
You are surrounded by people.
You pass them on the street and travel among them.
You visit them in their homes and connect with them online.
They are all children of God—your brothers and sisters.
God loves them just as He loves you.
Many of these people are searching for purpose in life.
They are concerned for their future and their families.
They need the sense of belonging that comes from knowing they are children of God and members of His eternal family.
They want to feel secure in a world of changing values.
They desire “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (
Doctrine and Covenants 59:23
).
Many are “only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (
Doctrine and Covenants 123:12
).
The gospel of Jesus Christ, as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, provides eternal truth.
This truth addresses people’s spiritual needs and helps them fulﬁll their deepest desires.
As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you teach that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah” (
2 Nephi 2:6
).
You invite people to come unto Christ to become converted to Him and His restored gospel.
As they accept your invitation, they will have greater happiness, hope, peace, and purpose.
To come to the Savior, people need to have faith in Him.
You can help them develop this faith as you:
Teach them the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and testify of its truth.
Invite them to commit to live according to its teachings.
Follow up and help them act on the commitments they make.
Help them have experiences in which they feel the influence of the Holy Ghost (see
1 Nephi 10:17–19
).
Faith in Jesus Christ will lead people to repent.
By atoning for our sins, Jesus makes repentance possible.
As people repent, they will be cleansed from sin and grow closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
They will experience the joy and peace of receiving forgiveness.
Repentance prepares people for the covenant of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. “Come unto me,” the Savior said, “and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day” (
3 Nephi 27:20
).
As your understanding and testimony of the Savior and His Atonement grow, your desire to share the gospel will increase.
You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great … importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (
2 Nephi 2:8
).

Personal or Companion Study
Examine the accompanying image as you study the vision of the tree of life in
1 Nephi 8
and
11
.
What does the tree of life symbolize in this vision? (See
1 Nephi 11:21–23
.)
What did Lehi desire after he ate the fruit? (See
1 Nephi 8:10–18
.)
In the vision, what did the people need to do to partake of the fruit?
What do we need to do to receive all the blessings of the Savior’s Atonement?
In what ways do commitments and covenants help us partake of these blessings?
How can you help others partake of the fruits of the gospel?
The Authority and Power of Your Calling
You are called and set apart to “[proclaim] glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (
Doctrine and Covenants 79:1
).
Like the sons of Mosiah, you can teach with the authority and power of God (see
Alma 17:2–3
).
Under Christ’s direction, the authority to preach the gospel was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith.
When you were set apart as a missionary, you received this authority.
With it comes the right, privilege, and responsibility to represent the Lord and teach His gospel.
This authority includes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling.
Take your setting apart literally.
Stay away from sin and from anything that is crude or vulgar.
Stay away from the ways and thinking of the world.
Follow the standards in
Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ
.
As the Lord’s representative, be “an example of the believers” (
1 Timothy 4:12
).
Honor the name of Jesus Christ by your actions and words.
In addition to authority, you need spiritual power to fulfill your calling.
God gives spiritual power as you consistently work to strengthen your testimony of Him, Jesus Christ, and the gospel truths you teach.
He bestows spiritual power as you pray, study the scriptures, and seek to fulfill your missionary purpose.
He grants spiritual power as you strive to keep His commandments and the covenants you made when you received the ordinances of salvation (see
Doctrine and Covenants 35:24
).
Spiritual power can be manifest as you:
Use the scriptures to teach people, deepen their understanding of gospel truths, and help them see how these truths apply to their lives (see
1 Nephi 19:23
;
Alma 26:13
;
31:5
).
Receive the Spirit’s guidance about what the Lord would have you say (see
Doctrine and Covenants 84:85
).
Receive the Spirit’s guidance about where to go and what to do (see
Doctrine and Covenants 28:15
;
31:11
;
75:26–27
).
Have your teaching and testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see
2 Nephi 33:1
;
Doctrine and Covenants 100:5–8
).
Take part in the ordinances of salvation (see
Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–20
).
Give priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see
James 5:14–15
).
Pray with and for the people you work with (see
Alma 6:6
;
8:18–22
;
10:7–11
;
31:26–35
;
Doctrine and Covenants 75:19
).
Express love and gratitude for the Lord, your family, other missionaries, and the people you serve (see
Doctrine and Covenants 59:7
;
78:19
).

What are your feelings about these blessings?
Seek to Have the Holy Ghost with You
You received the gift of the Holy Ghost when you were confirmed a member of the Church.
As a missionary—and throughout your life—one of your greatest needs will be to have the Holy Ghost with you (see
1 Nephi 10:17
;
3 Nephi 19:9
).
The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead.
The Holy Ghost guides, teaches, and comforts you.
He cleanses and sanctifies you.
He testifies of truth and bears witness of the Father and the Son.
He brings about your conversion and the conversion of those you teach. (See
3 Nephi 27:20
;
28:11
;
Ether 12:41
;
Moroni 8:26
;
10:5
;
John 15:26
.)
The Holy Ghost “will show unto you all things what ye should do” (
2 Nephi 32:5
).
He will magnify your abilities and service far beyond what you could do on your own.
Seeking to have the Holy Ghost with you should be one of your most earnest desires.
You will feel of His companionship as you:
Pray (see
Doctrine and Covenants 42:14
).
Treasure up God’s word (see
Doctrine and Covenants 11:21
;
84:85
).
Purify your heart (see
Doctrine and Covenants 112:28
).
Keep the commandments (see
Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21
).
Partake of the sacrament each week (see
Moroni 4–5
;
Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79
).

Nelson
“I plead with you to increase your spiritual capacity to receive revelation. … Choose to do the spiritual work required to enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost and hear the voice of the Spirit more frequently and more clearly” (Russell M.
Nelson, “
Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives
,”
Ensign
or
Liahona
, May 2018, 96).
Learn to Recognize the Spirit
You will better fulfill your missionary purpose as you learn to recognize and follow guidance from the Holy Ghost.
The Spirit usually communicates quietly, through your feelings and thoughts.
Devote yourself to seeking, recognizing, and following these subtle promptings.
They come in many ways (see
chapter 4
; see also
Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3
;
11:12–14
;
Galatians 5:22–23
).
Teach by the Spirit
The gospel of Jesus Christ is “the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (
Romans 1:16
).
For that reason, the message of the Restoration of the gospel needs to be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost.
The Lord said, “The Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (
Doctrine and Covenants 42:14
; see also
50:13–14, 17–22
).
As you teach by the power of the Holy Ghost, He will:
Teach you truth and bring the doctrine you have studied to your remembrance (see
John 14:26
).
Give you words to speak when you need them (see
Doctrine and Covenants 84:85
).
Carry your message unto the hearts of the people you teach (see
2 Nephi 33:1
).
Help you—and those who receive by the Spirit—to understand each other and be edified and rejoice together (see
Doctrine and Covenants 50:17–22
).
Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words to those who receive you (see
Doctrine and Covenants 100:5–8
).
The Lord will bless you abundantly as you seek, rely on, and teach by the Holy Ghost (see
chapters 4
and
10
).

The Gospel of Christ and Doctrine of Christ
The gospel of Jesus Christ deﬁnes both your message and your purpose.
It provides both the “what” and the “why” of your missionary service.
His gospel includes all the doctrine, principles, laws, commandments, ordinances, and covenants necessary for salvation and exaltation.
The gospel message is that we can access the saving, redeeming power of Jesus Christ by exercising faith in Him, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end (see
3 Nephi 27:13–22
).
This is also known as the doctrine of Christ.
Living this doctrine is how we come unto Christ and are saved (see
1 Nephi 15:14
).
This is powerfully taught in the Book of Mormon (see
2 Nephi 31
;
32:1–6
;
3 Nephi 11:31–40
).
Your purpose is to help people come unto Christ by helping them live His doctrine.

Faith in Jesus Christ
Faith is the foundation for all other gospel principles.
It is a principle of action and power.
Our faith needs to be centered in Jesus Christ for it to lead us to salvation.
The Savior taught, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (
John 3:16
).
Faith in Jesus Christ includes believing that He is the Only Begotten Son of God.
It is trusting Him as our Savior and Redeemer (see
Mosiah 3:17
;
4:6–10
;
Alma 5:7–15
).
It is having full confidence in Him and His word, teachings, and promises.
Our faith in Christ grows as we follow His teachings and example with full purpose of heart (see
2 Nephi 31:6–13
;
3 Nephi 27:21–22
).
As a missionary, help people make and keep commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ.
These commitments prepare them to receive ordinances and make and keep sacred covenants with God.
Repentance
Faith in Jesus Christ leads us to repent (see
Helaman 14:13
).
Repentance is the process of turning to God and turning away from sin.
As we repent, our actions, desires, and thoughts change to be more in harmony with God’s will.
Through His atoning sacrifice, the Savior paid the price for our sins (see
Mosiah 15:9
;
Alma 34:15–17
).
As we repent, we can be forgiven because of Jesus Christ and His sacrifice, for He claims His rights of mercy for the penitent (see
Moroni 7:27–28
).
In the words of the prophet Lehi, our “redemption cometh … through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (
2 Nephi 2:6, 8
).
Repentance is much more than exercising willpower to change a behavior or overcome a weakness.
Repentance is sincerely turning to Christ, who gives us the power to experience a “mighty change” in our hearts (see
Alma 5:12–14
).
It includes humbly yielding to the Spirit and submitting to God’s will.
As we repent, we increase our commitment to serve God and obey His commandments.
We are spiritually born again in Christ.
Repentance is a positive principle that brings joy and peace.
It brings us “unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of [our] souls” (
Helaman 5:11
).
Be bold and loving in helping people understand why they should repent.
By inviting the people you teach to make commitments, you invite them to repent and you offer them hope.
Scripture Study
What can you learn from the following scriptures about declaring repentance?
Alma 29:1–4

;
62:45
Helaman 5:11–12
Doctrine and Covenants 14:8
;
15:6
;
18:10–16
Baptism
Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinance of baptism. “The first fruits of repentance is baptism” (
Moroni 8:25
).
We enter the gate to eternal life when we are baptized by immersion by one who has authority from God.
When we are baptized, we make a covenant with God.
As we keep this covenant, God promises to give us the companionship of the Holy Ghost, forgive our sins, and give us membership in the Church of Jesus Christ (see
Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79
;
Moroni 6:4
).
We are gathered to the Lord and spiritually reborn through this joyous and hopeful ordinance.
Baptizing and confirming the people you teach are central to your purpose.
Help them understand that to qualify for baptism, they need to meet the conditions in
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
.
Companion Study
Search the following scriptures:
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
2 Nephi 31:13–17
Mosiah 18:8–10, 13
Alma 7:14–16
3 Nephi 11:21–41
Moroni 6:1–4
Based on your study of the scriptures above, make two written lists:
The qualifications for baptism
The covenants made at baptism
Discuss with your companion how to teach this to others.
Confirmation and the Gift of the Holy Ghost
Baptism comes in two parts: baptism of water and baptism of the Spirit.
After we are baptized by water, baptism is completed when we are confirmed by the laying on of hands by one who has authority from God.
Through confirmation we can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and a remission of our sins.
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith
[2007],
95
).
Alma taught, “All mankind … must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters; and thus they become new creatures” (
Mosiah 27:25–26
).
For the penitent, baptism of water and of the Spirit is spiritual rebirth.

Enduring to the End
Following Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment.
We endure to the end as we continue throughout our lives to exercise faith in Christ, repent daily, receive all the ordinances and covenants of the gospel, keep those covenants, and have the companionship of the Holy Ghost.
This includes renewing the covenants we have made by partaking of the sacrament.

The Gospel—Our Heavenly Father’s Path Back to Him
The gospel of Jesus Christ can change how we live and who we become.
Its principles are not just steps that we experience once in our lives.
When we repeat them throughout life, they bring us closer to God and become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living.
They bring peace, healing, and forgiveness.
They also define the path our Heavenly Father has given for us to have eternal life with Him.
The gospel of Jesus Christ guides how you work as a missionary.
It also focuses your efforts.
Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance (see
Alma 34:15–17
).
Teach and testify that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored.
Invite people to be baptized and live by the Savior’s teachings.
The Gospel of Jesus Christ Blesses All of God’s Children
The gospel of Jesus Christ is for all of God’s children.
The scriptures teach that “all are alike” unto God.
He invites “all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him” (
2 Nephi 26:33
).
The gospel blesses us throughout our mortal lives and throughout eternity.
We are most likely to be happy—both as individuals and as families—when we live by the teachings of Jesus Christ (see
Mosiah 2:41
; “
The Family: A Proclamation to the World
,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org).
Living the gospel deepens our joys, inspires our actions, and enriches our relationships.
One of the great messages of the restored gospel is that we are all part of God’s family.
We are His beloved sons and daughters.
Regardless of our family situation on earth, each of us is a member of the family of God.
Another great part of our message is that families can be united for eternity.
The family is ordained of God.
Latter-day prophets have taught:
“[Heavenly Father’s] divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave.
Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“
The Family: A Proclamation to the World
”).
Many people have limited opportunities for marriage or for loving family relationships.
Many have experienced divorce and other difficult family circumstances.
However, the gospel blesses us individually regardless of our family circumstance.
As we are faithful, God will provide a way for us to have the blessings of loving families, whether in this life or in the life to come (see
Mosiah 2:41
).
The Message of the Restoration: The Foundation of Faith
No matter where you serve or whom you teach, center your teaching on Jesus Christ and the Restoration of His gospel.
As you study the doctrine in the missionary lessons, you will see that we have one message: Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer.
Through a modern prophet, Heavenly Father has restored knowledge about His plan for our salvation.
This plan is centered on Jesus Christ.
Through His atoning sacrifice, the Savior makes it possible for all of us to be saved from sin and death and return to Heavenly Father.
Help the people you teach understand the following:
God is our literal Father in Heaven.
He loves us perfectly.
Every person on earth is a child of God and a member of His family.
Heavenly Father provided a plan for us to receive immortality and eternal life, which are His greatest blessings (see
Moses 1:39
).
We have come to earth to learn, grow, and prepare for the fulness of His blessings.
As part of His plan, Heavenly Father has given commandments to guide us during this life and help us return to Him (see, for example,
Exodus 20:3–17
).
In this life, we all sin, and we all die.
Because of Heavenly Father’s love for us, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem us from sin and death.
Because of Jesus’s atoning sacrifice, we can be cleansed of our sins as we repent and are baptized and confirmed.
This brings us peace and makes it possible for us to return to God’s presence and receive a fulness of joy.
Because of Jesus’s Resurrection, we will all be resurrected after we die.
This means that each person’s spirit and body will be reunited and live forever.
Throughout biblical history, the Lord revealed His gospel and organized His Church through prophets.
Repeatedly, most people rejected it.
A pattern of falling away from the gospel and the need to restore it began in Old Testament times.
After the Savior’s death and Resurrection, His Apostles led the Church for a time.
Eventually, they died, priesthood authority was lost, and there was another falling away from the Savior’s teachings.
People changed the doctrine and ordinances.
The gospel of Jesus Christ was restored by Heavenly Father through the Prophet Joseph Smith.
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph in the spring of 1820.
Joseph Smith later received priesthood authority and was directed to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again on the earth.
Teach that the Church of Jesus Christ is not just another religion.
Nor is it an American church.
Rather, it is a restoration of the “fulness of [the] gospel” of Jesus Christ (
Doctrine and Covenants 1:23
).
It will never be taken from the earth again.
The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ bears witness of Jesus Christ and His divine mission as the Savior of the world.
It is also a powerful witness that Jesus Christ restored His gospel and Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith.
Invite and help people to read the Book of Mormon and pray about its message.
Trust the remarkable promise in
Moroni 10:3–5
.
Encourage people to ask God sincerely and with real intent whether the Book of Mormon is the word of God.
Praying with real intent means being willing to act on the answer that comes from the witness of the Holy Ghost.
That witness becomes the foundation of a person’s faith that Christ has restored His Church.
Help those you teach to seek that spiritual confirmation.

Personal Study
Imagine you are going to write a paragraph about the message of the Restoration on social media or for a local news outlet.
In your study journal, write a title that describes the central message.
Then record your thoughts and feelings about this message.
Include how understanding it better has changed the way you live and the way you view the world around you.
Establish and Build Up the Church
When Jesus Christ restored His Church, He instructed the Prophet Joseph Smith and others to “establish” it and “build [it] up” (
Doctrine and Covenants 31:7
;
39:13
).
The Church is established and built up as people with testimonies are baptized and confirmed, keep their covenants, prepare to go to the temple, and help strengthen their ward or branch.
Image
man praying
As a missionary, you help establish and build up the Savior’s Church.
There are many ways you can do this.
You can support members as they share the gospel through the principles of loving, sharing, and inviting (see
General Handbook
,
23.1
).
You can help people receive baptism and grow in their faith.
You can help new members adjust to their new life and continue to grow spiritually.
You can also help returning members strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ.
New and returning members grow in testimony and faith when they experience the gospel working in their lives.
To help bring this about, it is important that they:
Have friends who are Church members.
Are given a responsibility in the Church.
Are nourished by God’s word.
(See Gordon B.
Hinckley, “
Converts and Young Men
,”
Ensign
, May 1997, 47.)
Missionaries, local leaders, and other Church members should gladly accept the opportunity to nourish and strengthen new and returning members.
This service helps “keep them in the right way” (
Moroni 6:4
).
Go about Doing Good
During His mortal ministry, the Savior served others.
He went about “doing good” and “preaching the gospel” (
Acts 10:38
;
Matthew 4:23
).
As you follow His example, you will find people you can serve and who will receive you.
Through service, you fulfill the two great commandments to love God and love your neighbor (see
Matthew 22:36–40
;
25:40
;
Mosiah 2:17
).
Through service, you and others may come together in a powerful, inspiring way.
As a missionary, you give
planned
service each week (see
Missionary Standards
,
2.7
and
7.2
, for information and guidelines).
Under the direction of your mission president, you may find opportunities to serve in the community through JustServe (where it is approved) and the Church’s humanitarian and disaster response efforts.
Throughout each day, pray and look for
unplanned
opportunities to do good.
Listen to the Spirit to recognize occasions for small acts of kindness you can offer.

A Successful Missionary
Your success as a missionary is determined primarily by your desire and commitment to find, teach, baptize, and confirm converts and to help them become faithful disciples of Christ and members of His Church (see
Alma 41:3
).
Your success is not determined by how many people you teach or help bring to baptism.
Nor is it determined by holding leadership positions.
Your success does not depend on how others choose to respond to you, to your invitations, or to your sincere acts of kindness.
People have agency to choose whether to accept the gospel message or not.
Your responsibility is to teach clearly and powerfully so they can make an informed choice that will bless them.
Think about the Savior’s parable of the talents in
Matthew 25:14–28
.
The master, who represents the Lord, praised both of His faithful servants even though the size of their offerings differed (see
Matthew 25:21, 23
).
He also gave them both the same reward, inviting them to enter “into the joy of thy lord” because they magnified what they were given.
God has given you talents and gifts to use in His service.
Your talents and gifts are different from those of others.
Recognize that all of these are important, including those that are less visible.
As you consecrate your talents and gifts to Him, He will magnify them and work miracles with what you offer.
Avoid comparing yourself to other missionaries and measuring the outward results of your efforts with theirs.
Comparing usually leads to negative outcomes, such as discouragement or pride.
Comparing is also often misleading.
What the Lord wants is your own best effort—for you to “serve him with all
your
heart, might, mind and strength” (
Doctrine and Covenants 4:2
; emphasis added).
You may be sad if people do not accept the gospel yet.
Sometimes you may feel discouraged.
Even the great missionaries and prophets in the scriptures have sometimes felt discouragement (see
2 Nephi 4:17–19
;
Alma 26:27
).
In such times, follow the example of Nephi by turning to the Lord, placing your trust in Him, praying for strength, and remembering the good things He has done for you (see
2 Nephi 4:16–35
).
Image
two missionaries praying
As you turn to the Lord in difficult times, He has promised, “I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee” (
Isaiah 41:10
).
Through exercising faith in Christ, you can find peace and reassurance about your efforts.
Faith will help you press forward and continue in righteous desires.
Remain focused on your commitment to Christ and your missionary purpose—not the outward results.
These results often are not evident immediately.
At the same time, keep your expectations high regardless of the challenges you face.
High expectations will increase your effectiveness, your desire, and your ability to follow the Spirit.
Some ways you can evaluate your commitment to the Lord and your effort to be a successful missionary are outlined below.
Seek earnestly to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, learning of Him and improving little by little (see
John 8:31
;
2 Nephi 28:30
).
Seek Christlike attributes (see
2 Peter 1:2–9
;
Doctrine and Covenants 4:5–6
).
Love people sincerely and do your best every day to bring souls to Christ (see
1 Corinthians 13
;
Moroni 7:45–48
).
Invite and help people to make and keep commitments that build their faith in the Savior.
Study the scriptures, and pray earnestly to express thanks and ask for divine help (see
John 5:39
;
2 Nephi 32:3
;
Enos 1:4
;
Alma 37:37
;
Doctrine and Covenants 26:1
).
Obey God’s commandments and observe the missionary standards (see
Doctrine and Covenants 35:24
).
Live so the Spirit can guide you in where to go, what to do, and what to say (see
Doctrine and Covenants 18:18
;
42:14
).
Prayerfully set goals, make plans, and work to fulfill them (see
Luke 14:28
;
Doctrine and Covenants 88:119
).
Build up and strengthen the ward or branch where you are assigned (see
Doctrine and Covenants 18:5
).
Go about doing good and serving people at every opportunity, whether they accept your message or not (see
Acts 10:38
).
When you have done your best, you may still have disappointments, but you will not be disappointed in yourself.
You can feel assured that the Lord is pleased when you feel the Spirit working through you.

Record what you learn in your study journal.
Remember This
Your purpose is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
Your calling gives you authority; keeping your covenants gives you power.
Teach the first principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Invite and help people to make and keep commitments that build their faith in the Savior.
The gospel of Jesus Christ blesses all of God’s children.
The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith.
The Book of Mormon can help people gain a testimony of this.
Your success is determined primarily by your
desire
and
commitment
to find, teach, baptize, and confirm converts.

How did they feel about the missionaries?
How did they feel about what the missionaries taught?
What helped them keep commitments?
What most strongly influenced their conversion?
Several days before the meeting, assign several missionaries to ponder selected questions from “Consider This” at the beginning of the chapter.
Ask each missionary to prepare a two- to three-minute talk on the assigned question.
During the district council or zone conference, invite the missionaries to give their talks.
After the talks, discuss what was learned and how it could be used in missionary work.
Divide the missionaries into four groups.
Ask each group to list as many truths, covenants, and ordinances as they can that were restored and revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith.
Have each group share their lists.
Invite missionaries to share how any of the truths revealed through the Restoration have influenced their lives.
Discuss what it means to be a successful missionary.
Invite missionaries to give specific examples.
Mission Leaders and Mission Counselors
During interviews or in conversation with missionaries, periodically ask them to share with you:
Their testimony of Jesus Christ.
Their testimony of the restored gospel and the mission of Joseph Smith.
Their testimony of the Book of Mormon.
Their thoughts about their purpose as a missionary.
Invite missionaries to record in their study journal what they feel are some of the purposes of their mission.
During an interview or in conversation, ask them to share what they have written.
Send a letter of congratulations to new members.

Search the Scriptures and Put on the Armor of God
Consider This
Why is it important to consistently study the word of God in the scriptures?
How can I make my scripture study more effective?
How can I use technology righteously to help me fulfill my purpose?
What does it mean to put on the armor of God?
Search the Scriptures
Jesus Christ “is the life and the light of the world.
Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness” (
Alma 38:9
; see also
John 1
).
Studying the word of God in the holy scriptures will bring abundance to your life (see
John 10:10
).
His words will fill you—and those you teach—with light and truth.
They will help you—and those you teach—live righteously and receive divine protection and strength.
They will help you come to know Him and taste His love, which is sweet above all that is sweet.
His words will fill your soul with joy (
1 Nephi 8:11–12
; see
verses 1–34
).
The scriptures are a heavenly gift.
One of the great blessings of your mission is having a scheduled time to study them every day.
Gospel study is one of the most rewarding kinds of spiritual work you can do.
It is invigorating both mentally and spiritually.
As Alma taught, when you “plant” the word of God in your heart, it will “enlighten [your] understanding” and become delicious to you (
Alma 32:28
; see also
Enos 1:3–4
).
As you continue to study and apply God’s word, it will “take root; and … be a tree springing up unto everlasting life” (
Alma 32:41
; see also
verses 42–43
).
Your knowledge and testimony of the gospel will increase.
Your desire and ability to share the gospel will also increase.
Learning from a good teacher is important, but it is also important for you to have meaningful learning experiences from your own study of the scriptures.
This is also true for the people you teach.
Understanding the scriptures may be challenging at first.
However, as you patiently persist in studying the word of God, your understanding will grow.
You will come to treasure your time with the scriptures.
You will eagerly look forward to what you will learn and experience.
Coming to know and love the scriptures can be a great lifelong blessing of your missionary service.
As you experience the blessings of scripture study during your mission, you will want to continue for the rest of your life.

Elder D.
Todd Christofferson
“The central purpose of all scripture is to fill our souls with faith in God the Father and in His Son, Jesus Christ—faith that They exist; faith in the Father’s plan for our immortality and eternal life; faith in the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, which animates this plan of happiness; faith to make the gospel of Jesus Christ our way of life; and faith to come to know ‘the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom [He has] sent’ (
John 17:3

Seek the Spirit
Learning the gospel is much more than gaining information.
It is also a spiritual process of applying eternal truth under the guidance of the Holy Ghost (see
Jacob 4:8
;
Doctrine and Covenants 50:19–25
).
Seek and trust the Spirit to teach you as you study the scriptures.
This will happen to the degree that you liken the scriptures to yourself with real intent to act on what you learn (see
1 Nephi 19:23
;
Moroni 10:4
;
Joseph Smith—History 1:18
).
Prayerfully studying the scriptures will open a window of revelation for the Spirit to speak to your mind and heart.
He will bless you with guidance, inspiration, and answers to your questions.
Through your study of the scriptures, the Holy Ghost will strengthen and comfort you.
He will give you knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and enable you to bless others eternally.

Look for Answers to Questions
As a missionary, you will hear many questions.
You will also have questions of your own.
Searching the scriptures and other approved resources for answers to these questions is a powerful way to study.
Record the questions and what you learn and feel in your study journal.
Use accurate, reliable sources in your study—primarily the scriptures, the words of the living prophets, and
Preach My Gospel
.
Use the resources in Gospel Library, such as the
Guide to the Scriptures
,

, and
Gospel Topics essays
.
Learn which resources are available in the languages of the people you teach.

President M.
Russell Ballard
“One thing I have learned in life is how frequently the Lord answers our questions and gives us counsel through the scriptures. … Let us then go to the Lord in prayer, pleading for help or answers; and those answers will come as we open the scriptures and begin to study them.
Sometimes it is as though a passage hundreds or thousands of years old was dictated specifically to answer our question” (M. Russell Ballard, “
Be Strong in the Lord, and in the Power of His Might
” [Brigham Young University fireside, Mar. 3, 2002], 5, speeches.byu.edu).
Live What You Learn
As you feel the joy that comes from growing in understanding the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn.
Strive to live in harmony with what you learn.
Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony.
Acting on what you learn will bring added and enduring understanding. (See
John 7:17
.)

Use Technology Righteously
The Lord and His prophets have entrusted you with technology to help accomplish His work.
Technology can enhance your study of the scriptures and
Preach My Gospel
.
Digital resources can also help you plan.
They can help in your teaching and in your efforts to find people to teach.
Using technology wisely and righteously can help you fulfill your missionary purpose and use time effectively.
It can also help you avoid inappropriate material.
Follow the Spirit about when and how to use technology in ways that will help strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ and the faith of those you serve and teach.
Follow the Safeguards for Using Technology
The four safeguards outlined below will help you use technology appropriately.
Following these safeguards is an important way for you to “put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil” (
Ephesians 6:11
).
Be in Tune with Spiritual Promptings
Nephi promised, “If ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do” (
2 Nephi 32:5
).
Your Heavenly Father has given you two powerful gifts that will help you: moral agency and the gift of the Holy Ghost.
You have the power to choose to follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost.
His guidance is vital in helping you do good while using technology.
It also helps protect you from evil.
Be Focused on Your Missionary Purpose
The Lord said, “If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things” (
Doctrine and Covenants 88:67
).
To have your eye single to the glory of God means having your focus completely on God’s purpose, which is also your purpose as a missionary.
Your use of technology should be centered on your purpose.
Turn on your device only after you have identified the missionary purpose for which you will use it.
Then turn it off when that purpose is completed.
You are more likely to encounter inappropriate content on the internet when you are casually surfing the web without a specific purpose in mind.
Image

Be Disciplined
Mormon wrote: “I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life” (
3 Nephi 5:13
).
Like Mormon, you are a disciple of Christ.
Serving as a full-time missionary is a special opportunity to deepen your discipleship.
The words
disciple
and
discipline
come from the same root word that means “learner” or “pupil.” To be a disciple of Christ means that you seek to follow Him and keep His commandments.
It means that you consistently learn and teach of Christ.
Be disciplined and make righteous choices in how you use technology.
Choose to follow the safeguards.
When you are talking face-to-face with people, do not check messages or answer calls.
Take control of how you use these devices.
Do not let them control you.
The Lord declared, “He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple” (
Doctrine and Covenants 41:5
).
While no one is perfect, the Lord expects consistent, persistent effort to follow Him.
The beauty of the gospel is that we can be forgiven as we repent—and the Lord wants us to repent without delay (see
Doctrine and Covenants 109:21
).
If you make a mistake, including inappropriate use of technology, repent in that moment and keep trying to live His law.
This is part of being a disciple of Christ.
Be One
The Lord said, “Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine” (
Doctrine and Covenants 38:27
).
Help your mission develop a culture of unity, trust, accountability, and compassion so you can strengthen and support one another.
All missionaries should feel comfortable asking for help when needed.
A missionary who is strong in the Spirit can help one who is feeling weak (see
Doctrine and Covenants 84:106
).
If you feel tempted, ask your companion or mission leader for help.
Nearly all challenges associated with the internet or with pornography happen in isolation.
Use devices only when you can see each other’s screens.
Have courage and be accountable to each other.
The Lord has confidence in each missionary He has called, including you.
He has provided companions and leaders to help protect and support you.
Just as Alma supported his companion Amulek, seek to strengthen each other (see
Alma 15:18
).
What Should You Do If You Feel Vulnerable or Susceptible?
Learning to follow these four safeguards requires effort, discipline, and practice.
Even after the safeguards become a natural part of how you think and act, you will have times when you may feel vulnerable or susceptible.
Perhaps you had some poor technology habits before your mission that have been difficult to overcome.
Some missionaries struggled with pornography before their call and may be tempted to fall back into former patterns of behavior.
The principles below will help you live the safeguards and fortify yourself against temptation:
Be aware of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
Understand how they can make you more vulnerable to misusing technology.
Choose to act.
Respond in righteous, productive ways to what you are feeling.
Learn, repent, and improve.
Use your experiences to continue learning and improving.
You do not have to overcome challenges on your own.
Rely on the strength that comes through the Savior’s Atonement and the covenants you have made with Him.
The Lord knows the challenges you face, and He will help you in this great work.
Always remembering the Savior can help you use technology righteously.
Be true to the trust He has given you.
Determine to “walk uprightly before him” (
Alma 53:21
; see also
verse 20
).
Feeling gratitude for all that He and the Father have done for you will help you make good choices about how you use digital resources.
Your mission is a great opportunity to learn to use technology wisely.
The commitment and good habits you develop during your mission will benefit you for the rest of your life.
Put on the Armor of God
Your ability to resist temptation will increase as you study and apply the scriptures, the words of the living prophets,
Preach My Gospel
,
Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ
, and the safeguards outlined in this chapter.

By putting on the “whole armour of God,” you will be able to discern truth from error.
You will have your feet shod with the “gospel of peace.” Putting “on the breastplate of righteousness” will protect you.
With the “shield of faith,” you will be able to quench the fiery darts of the adversary.
You will take “the sword of [His] Spirit” to teach truth with power and authority.
You will be fortified against worldly influences that could otherwise lead you to become adrift, isolated, and even alienated. (See

Remember This
Searching the scriptures and developing daily study habits to learn the gospel will bless you greatly as a missionary and throughout your life.
You learn the gospel by study, faith, and the power of the Holy Ghost.
Using technology righteously will help you fulfill your missionary purpose and bless you throughout your life.
Follow the safeguards for using technology.
Put on the armor of God.
Ideas for Study and Application
Personal Study
Try some of the following suggestions to enhance your study:
Read the scriptures with questions and concerns in mind.
Share what you learn with other missionaries and with those you teach.
Explaining a doctrine or principle will help you remember it and gain clarity.
Study by topic.
Focus on topics that will help you and the people you teach.
Ask yourself, “What is the author saying?
What is the main message?
How does this apply to me?
How might this help someone we are teaching?”
Visualize or draw what you are studying.
For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king.
Write the main idea of a passage in a sentence or short paragraph.
Memorize scriptures that explain and support the principles you teach.
Evaluate yourself on the following (1=never, 3=some of the time, and 5=almost always).
I am growing in my faith and coming to know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ better.
I think about the people I am teaching when I study.
Throughout the day, I think about what I studied in the morning.
As I study, ideas come to my mind that have not occurred to me before.
I record spiritual impressions and ideas in an appropriate place.
I stay awake as I study.
I look forward to personal study.
I look forward to companion study.
Review your responses.
What are you doing well?
How could you improve?
Set one or two goals to improve the quality of your study.
Companion Study and Companion Exchange

During interviews or conversations, ask some of the following questions:
What impressions have you had recently in your scripture study?
What chapter or section of
Preach My Gospel
has helped you most in the past two weeks?
How has it helped you?
What are you doing in your personal study that helps you learn?
In interviews, consider reviewing the safeguards for using technology and asking missionaries what they are learning as they apply them.
Share insights from your personal study.
Share entries from your study journal and your testimony of the importance of gospel study.

The Baptism of Christ, by Joseph Brickey
Chapter 3
Study and Teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ
The lessons in this chapter contain the essential doctrine, principles, and commandments of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
These lessons are what the living prophets and apostles have instructed you to learn and teach.
They are provided here so you can help others clearly understand the doctrine of Christ.
The first section in this chapter is the baptismal invitation.
The rest of the chapter consists of the following four lessons:
The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
Heavenly Father’s Plan of Salvation
The Gospel of Jesus Christ
Becoming Lifelong Disciples of Jesus Christ
Study the scriptures and treasure up the doctrine in each lesson.
As you do, the Spirit will bear witness of the truths you study.
He will help you know what to say and do to help others receive a witness of the truth. (See
Doctrine and Covenants 84:85
.)
People will come to know the Savior more fully as they do what He has invited them to do.
Extend invitations in each lesson, and help people keep their commitments.
As people keep commitments, they begin to live the gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to make covenants with God.
Teach all the lessons before and after baptism.
Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching the lessons both times.
Ward missionaries or other members participate when possible.
See
chapters 10
and
13
for information about including members in teaching.
Prepare to Teach
As you prepare to teach, review the information for each person in the Preach My Gospel app.
Make a lesson plan based on the person’s needs.
Consider what he or she should know and feel during your teaching visit.
The Spirit will magnify your efforts as you take time to prepare and plan.
Here are some questions for you and your companion to prayerfully consider as you prepare to teach.
What invitation will we extend to help the person build faith in Christ and make progress?
Invitations are how you help people repent and experience “the power of the Redeemer” (
Helaman 5:11
).
Consider the person’s progress, situation, and needs.
Then include one or more invitations in your lesson plan.
What doctrine and principles will help the person keep the commitment we have invited him or her to make?
Prayerfully determine what doctrine and principles will help people understand why keeping their commitment is important for them and to the Lord.
How will we help the person learn the doctrine?
To prepare to teach the doctrine, organize and summarize what you will teach using
lessons 1–4
.
Identify questions, scriptures, examples, and appropriate media that will help the person understand what you teach.
See
chapter 10
for information about how to improve your teaching.
What blessings has God promised for accepting and keeping commitments?
As you study the doctrine, identify God’s promised blessings.
As you teach, promise blessings and bear testimony of them.
Which members could participate?
In the weekly coordination meeting, determine which members could help you teach and support the person.
Before the lesson, discuss their participation.
See
chapter 10
.
What can we do to help people keep their commitments after we leave?
Follow up by making a brief daily contact to help people keep their commitments.
Look for ways to include members in helping those you teach keep their commitments.
This contact could include reading a chapter from the Book of Mormon or other scriptures.
If someone is not keeping a previous commitment, it may be better to help with that before extending another one.
See
chapter 11
.
How can we better help them next time?
After every teaching situation, evaluate the experience of the people you are teaching.
Is their faith in Christ growing?
Are they feeling the Spirit?
Are they repenting and making and keeping commitments?
Are they praying, studying the Book of Mormon, and attending church?
Make plans to help them.
Teach from Your Heart as Guided by the Spirit
Speaking to all elders and sisters, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated:
“Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught.
It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation.
The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit.
He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms.
He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the [person].
Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words, he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings.”
The Role of Memorization
Commit to memory the sequence of the teachings in each lesson.
Do not memorize lessons word for word.
If you are learning a second language, focus your language study on preparing to teach the lessons.
Memorize vocabulary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lessons.
Memorizing the outlines in
lessons 1–3
can also be helpful.
What you memorize should become personally meaningful to you.
Consider memorizing key doctrinal scriptures to use in your teaching and your personal life.
Great power can come from memorizing scriptures.
These scriptures can strengthen you and give you inspiration and comfort.
They can prompt you to change.
When you memorize scriptures, the Spirit can bring them to your mind when you need them.

Teach and Invite according to Individual Needs
You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way helps people fully prepare for baptism and confirmation.
Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the person you are teaching and the guidance of the Spirit.
For example, when teaching people who do not have a Christian background, you might begin by helping them develop a greater connection with Heavenly Father and an understanding of His plan (see “
Teaching People Who Do Not Have a Christian Background
” in chapter 10).
Let the Spirit guide you in what invitations to extend and when to extend them.
The right invitation at the right time can prompt people to do things that will build their faith.
These actions can lead to a mighty change of heart (see
Mosiah 5:2
;
Alma 5:12–14
).
Teach lessons that are simple, clear, and brief.
Typically, a teaching visit should not be longer than 30 minutes, and you can teach a person in as few as 5 minutes.
You will usually need multiple meetings to teach the principles in one lesson.
People will often better understand your message if you teach short lessons, teach frequently, and teach small portions of material.

The Invitation to Be Baptized and Confirmed
Image
Come into the Fold of God, by Walter Rane
Doctrinal Foundation
We are all children of Heavenly Father.
We have come to earth to have the opportunity to learn, grow, and become more like Him so we can return to His presence (see
Moses 1:39
).
We cannot become like Him or return to Him without divine help.
Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for us and break the bands of death (see
3 Nephi 27:13–22
).
We gain access to Christ’s redeeming power by exercising faith in Him unto repentance, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost through confirmation, and enduring to the end.
Keeping the covenant of baptism is the first step in binding ourselves to God so the Holy Ghost can cleanse, strengthen, and change our nature for the better.
Experiencing this sanctifying influence is called spiritual rebirth. (See
2 Nephi 31:7, 13–14, 20–21
;
Mosiah 5:1–7
;
18
;
27:24
;
3 Nephi 27:20
;
John 3:5
.)
Spiritual rebirth begins when we are baptized by water and the Spirit.
Baptism is a joyous and hopeful ordinance.
When we are baptized with a broken heart and contrite spirit, we start life anew with God’s sustaining power.
After we are baptized and confirmed, we can continue to be strengthened by partaking of the sacrament worthily. (See
2 Nephi 31:13
;
Mosiah 18:7–16
;
Moroni 6:2
;
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
.)
Extending the Invitation
As you feel guided by the Spirit, invite people to be baptized and confirmed.
This may happen during any lesson.
Teach the doctrine of baptism and help people understand the doctrine of Christ (see
lesson 3
).
Teach about the importance and joy of the baptismal covenant, of receiving a remission of sins, and of receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost through confirmation.
Prepare people for the baptismal invitation by making sure they understand what you have taught and the covenant they will make.
The covenant of baptism is as follows:
Be willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ.
Keep the commandments of God.
Serve God and others.
Endure to the end. (See
lesson 4
.)
You might share the following:
“When we are baptized, we ‘witness before [God] that [we] have entered into a covenant with him, that [we] will serve him and keep his commandments.’ As we make this covenant, He promises that He will ‘pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon [us]’ (
Mosiah 18:10
).”
Your invitation to be baptized should be specific and direct.
You might say:
“Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone who has been ordained to perform this ordinance?
We will help you prepare for baptism.
We believe you can be ready on [date].
Will you prepare to be baptized on that date?”
As with any invitation you extend, promise the great blessings people will receive as they accept the invitation to be baptized and keep the associated covenants.
Share your testimony of these blessings.
Teach that baptism and confirmation are not a final destination.
Rather, they are a point along the path of conversion that brings hope, joy, and the power of God more fully into a person’s life (see
Mosiah 27:25–26
).
After people are baptized and confirmed, they can look forward to being sanctified by the Spirit as they progress along the covenant path.
If possible, invite those you are teaching to attend a baptismal service and a sacrament meeting during which someone is confirmed.
Ideas for the Invitation to Be Baptized
Consider reading the scriptural account of Jesus being baptized (see
Matthew 3:13–17
).
You could also show the
Bible video
depicting the Savior’s baptism or the
Book of Mormon video
of the Savior’s disciples baptizing.
You could also read Nephi’s account of Jesus’s baptism (see
2 Nephi 31:4–12
).
Reading the accounts of the baptism of Jesus Christ can strengthen those being taught.
Scripture Study
Study the following scriptures:
2 Nephi 31:4–12
Moroni 6
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
;
22
Matthew 3:13–17
Write a summary of what you have learned.
Teaching Insight
Heavenly Father may have blessed the people you find with valuable spiritual preparation.
The steps they have already taken may have prepared them to make covenants with God through baptism in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Chapter 3: Lesson 1
The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
Image
The First Vision
People May Wonder
Does God exist?
How can I feel closer to God?
How can I learn truth in today’s confusing world?
How could religion help me?
Why are there so many churches?
Why do I have so many challenges?
How can I find peace in times of turmoil?
How can I be happier?
How could a prophet help the world today?
From the beginning of the world, God has revealed the gospel to His children through prophets.
He has done this through His Son, Jesus Christ.
Anciently, Jesus revealed the gospel to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses.
But many people rejected it.
Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel and established His Church.
People even rejected Jesus.
Soon after His death, there was a widespread falling away from the Lord’s truth and Church.
The fulness of the gospel and the priesthood authority were no longer on the earth.
Centuries later, God called another prophet, Joseph Smith.
God restored the fulness of the gospel through him and authorized him to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again.
Having the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ on the earth is one of the great blessings of our day.
The gospel helps us answer life’s most searching questions.
Living prophets guide us through challenging times.
The priesthood authority of God is once again on the earth to bless His children.

Suggestions for Teaching
This section provides a sample outline to help you prepare to teach.
It also includes examples of questions and invitations you might use.
As you prepare to teach, prayerfully consider each person’s situation and spiritual needs.
Decide what will be most helpful to teach.
Prepare to define terms that people might not understand.
Plan according to how much time you will have, remembering to keep lessons brief.
Select scriptures to use as you teach.
The “
Doctrinal Foundation
” section of the lesson includes many helpful scriptures.
Consider which questions to ask as you teach.
Plan invitations to extend that will encourage each person to act.
Emphasize God’s promised blessings, and share your testimony of what you teach.
What You Might Teach People in 15–25 Minutes
Select one or more of the following principles to teach.
The doctrinal foundation for each principle is provided after this outline.
God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father
God is our Heavenly Father, and we are His children.
He created us in His image.
God knows us personally and loves us.
God has a glorified, perfected body of flesh and bones.
God wants to bless us with peace and a fulness of joy that will last for eternity.
Because God loves us, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem us from sin and death.
God Reveals the Gospel through Prophets in Every Dispensation
God calls prophets to be His representatives on earth.
Anciently, God called prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses.
A living prophet receives revelation from God to teach and lead us today.
Jesus Christ’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement
Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
During His earthly ministry, Jesus taught His gospel and established His Church.
Jesus called twelve Apostles and gave them authority to lead His Church.
At the end of His life, Jesus atoned for our sins by His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and during the Crucifixion.
After Jesus’s death, He was resurrected.
Because of Jesus’s atoning sacrifice, we can be forgiven and cleansed of our sins as we repent.
This brings us peace and makes it possible for us to return to God’s presence and receive a fulness of joy.
Because of Jesus’s Resurrection, we will all be resurrected after we die.
This means that each person’s spirit and body will be reunited and live forever.
The Falling Away
After Jesus’s Apostles died, there was a widespread falling away from the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ.
During this time, people changed many gospel teachings.
People also changed priesthood ordinances, such as baptism.
Priesthood authority and the Church that Jesus had established were no longer on the earth.
The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith
Joseph Smith sought to know which church was God’s true Church so he could join it.
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Him in 1820.
This event is called the First Vision.
God called Joseph Smith to be a prophet, just as He had called prophets in earlier times.
The gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through Joseph Smith.
Other heavenly messengers restored the priesthood, and Joseph was authorized to organize the Church of Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ continues to lead His Church today through living prophets and apostles.
The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ
The Book of Mormon is a volume of scripture written in ancient times by prophets in the Americas.
Joseph Smith translated it by the gift and power of God.
With the Bible, the Book of Mormon provides a witness of Jesus’s ministry, teachings, and mission as our Savior.
We can get nearer to God by reading the Book of Mormon and abiding by its precepts.
We can know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God by reading it, pondering it, and praying about it.
This process will also help us come to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet.
Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost
Prayer is a two-way communication between God and His children.
Through sincere prayer, we can know that the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ is true.
As we pray, the Holy Ghost teaches and confirms truth to us.

God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father
God is our Heavenly Father, and we are His children.
He created us in His image.
He has a glorified, perfected “body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s” (
Doctrine and Covenants 130:22
).
God knows us personally, and He loves us more than we can comprehend.
He understands our trials, sorrows, and weaknesses, and He offers to support us through them.
He rejoices in our progress and will help us make right choices.
He wants to communicate with us, and we can communicate with Him through prayer.
God has given us this experience on earth so we can learn, grow, and become more like Him.
With perfect love, He wants us to return to Him after we die.
However, we cannot do this on our own.
Because God loves us, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem us. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, … that the world through him might be saved” (
John 3:16–17
).
God wants to bless us with peace and a fulness of joy that will last for eternity.
He has provided a plan that gives us the opportunity to receive these blessings.
This plan is called the plan of salvation (see
lesson 2
).
Belief about God
Learn what the person you are teaching believes about God.
Most people believe in some kind of a Supreme Being even though there are many perceptions of Deity.
However, many people have no concept of God.
Two Book of Mormon missionaries, Ammon and Aaron, taught people who did not have a Christian background.
They taught simple truths and invited the people to pray.
As a result, Lamoni and his father were converted.
Study
Alma 18:24–40
and
22:4–23
.
Then answer the questions below:
What did these missionaries teach about the nature of God?
How can you follow their examples?
For more information, see “
Teaching People Who Do Not Have a Christian Background
” in chapter 10.

Moses and the Tablets, by Jerry Harston
God Reveals the Gospel through Prophets in Every Dispensation
Prophets Are God’s Representatives on Earth
One important way that God shows His love for us is by calling prophets, giving them priesthood authority, and inspiring them to speak for Him.
Prophets are God’s representatives on earth.
The Old Testament prophet Amos recorded that “the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets” (
Amos 3:7
).
Some of the blessings we receive from living prophets are outlined below.
Witnesses of Jesus Christ.
Prophets are special witnesses of Jesus Christ, testifying of Him as our Savior and Redeemer.
Teachings.
Prophets receive direction from God to help us discern truth from error.
They teach us to obey God’s commandments and to repent when we fall short.
They denounce sin and warn of its consequences.
Prophets’ teachings lift us toward God and help us receive the blessings He desires for us.
Our greatest safety lies in following the word of the Lord given through His prophets.
Priesthood Authority.
The current prophet is the presiding priesthood holder on the earth.
The priesthood is the authority and power of God.
The prophet has the authority to speak and act in God’s name for the salvation of His children.
Church Direction.
The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of prophets and apostles (see
Ephesians 2:19–20
;
4:11–14
).
Prophets in Ancient Times
Adam was the first prophet on the earth.
God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ to him and gave him priesthood authority.
Adam and Eve taught their children these truths and encouraged them to develop faith and to live the gospel.
Eventually the posterity of Adam and Eve rebelled and turned away from the gospel.
This led to a condition called apostasy, or a falling away.
When widespread apostasy occurs, God withdraws His priesthood authority, which is necessary to teach and administer the ordinances of the gospel.
The Old Testament records many instances of widespread apostasy.
To end these periods, God reached out to His children by calling another prophet.
He revealed the truths of the gospel anew to these prophets and gave them priesthood authority.
Some of these prophets were Noah, Abraham, and Moses.
Sadly, in a repeated pattern over time, people eventually rejected the prophets and fell away.
Teaching Insights
Prophets
Learn what the person you are teaching understands about prophets.
People in most cultures believe that holy or inspired people receive some form of guidance and direction from Deity.
However, not all inspired individuals are prophets of God.
Explain that after each time of widespread apostasy, God restored the gospel through a prophet.
He gave that prophet priesthood authority.
The prophet helped people understand their relationship to God, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Dispensations
A dispensation of the gospel of Jesus Christ is a period of time in which there is least one authorized servant of the Lord on the earth who holds the keys of the priesthood.
Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation has been revealed anew in every dispensation.
There have been many gospel dispensations.
Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ, Joseph Smith, and others have each led a dispensation.
The dispensation that began with Joseph Smith is known as the “dispensation of the fulness of times” (
Ephesians 1:10
).
See Bible Dictionary, “
Dispensations
,” and Guide to the Scriptures, “
Dispensation
.”

O My Father, by Simon Dewey
Jesus Christ’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement
Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
Jesus and His Atonement are central to God’s plan for us.
His Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, His suffering and death on the cross, and His Resurrection.
From the time of Adam and Eve, people looked forward to the coming of Jesus Christ as their Savior and Redeemer.
Heavenly Father sent Jesus to earth more than 2,000 years ago.
Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life.
He taught His gospel and established His Church.
He called twelve Apostles and gave them priesthood authority to teach and to perform sacred ordinances, such as baptism.
He also gave them authority to lead His Church.
At the end of His life, Jesus atoned for our sins by His suffering in Gethsemane and during His Crucifixion.
Because of Jesus’s atoning sacrifice, we can be cleansed of our sins as we repent.
This makes it possible for us to return to God’s presence and receive a fulness of joy.
After Jesus was crucified, He was resurrected, gaining victory over death by the power of Heavenly Father.
Because of Jesus’s Resurrection, all of us will be resurrected after we die.
This means that each person’s spirit and body will be reunited, and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body. (See “
The Atonement of Jesus Christ
” in lesson 2.)
Image
the Prophet Joseph Smith
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it” (
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith

The Falling Away
After the death of Jesus Christ, His Apostles sought to keep the doctrine of Christ pure and to maintain order in the Church.
However, many Church members turned away from the Apostles and from the doctrine that Jesus had taught.
After the Apostles were killed, there was a widespread falling away from the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ.
This falling away is sometimes called the Great Apostasy.
Because of it, God withdrew priesthood authority from the earth.
This loss included the authority needed to direct the Church.
As a result, the Church that Jesus had established was no longer on the earth.
During this time, people changed many gospel teachings.
Much of the knowledge about the true nature of Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was distorted or lost.
People also changed priesthood ordinances, such as baptism.
Centuries later, truth-seeking men and women tried to reform the teachings and practices that had been changed.
They sought greater spiritual light, and some of them spoke of the need for a restoration of truth.
Their efforts led to the organization of many churches.
This period of time resulted in an increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for the restoration of truth and authority from God.
Prophets and apostles had foretold the falling away (see
2 Thessalonians 2:1–3
).
They had also foretold that the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ would be restored to the earth (see
Acts 3:20–21
).
If there had not been a falling away, a restoration would not have been needed.
Teaching Insight: The Falling Away
Teach people about the falling away at a level of detail appropriate to their needs and background.
Help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Key Points You Might Teach
Most people rejected Jesus Christ and His Apostles (see
Matthew 24:9
;
1 Nephi 11:32–34
;
2 Nephi 27:5
).
After the deaths of the Apostles, the priesthood was lost from the earth.
There was no longer authority to baptize or to direct the Church.
The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity.
Important religious questions were settled by debate in councils rather than by revelation from God.
Doctrine and ordinances were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies.
Creeds, or statements of belief, were created based on the decisions of these councils (see
Joseph Smith—History 1:19
).
Some people tried to reform Christianity by correcting what existed.
However, because God’s priesthood authority was not on the earth, a restoration of authority and truth was needed to reestablish the Church of Jesus Christ.

The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith
The First Vision and the Calling of Joseph Smith as a Prophet
During the centuries when the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was not on the earth, Heavenly Father continued to reach out to His children.
Over time, He prepared the way so they could be blessed again with the fulness of His gospel.
When the circumstances were right, He called Joseph Smith as a prophet through whom the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ would be restored.
Joseph Smith lived in the eastern United States at a time of great religious excitement.
His family members were devoted to God and sought truth.
Many churches claimed to have the truth, and Joseph desired to know which one was right (see
Joseph Smith—History 1:18
).
The Bible teaches there is “one Lord, one faith, one baptism” (
Ephesians 4:5
).
As Joseph attended different churches, he was confused about which one to join.
He later said:
“So great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was … to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. …
“In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done?
Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together?
If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (
Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10
).
Like many people, Joseph Smith also had questions about the salvation of his soul.
He wanted to have his sins forgiven and to be clean before God.
As he sought truth among the different churches, he read in the Bible, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (
James 1:5
).
Because of this passage, Joseph decided to ask God what he should do.
In the spring of 1820, he went to a grove of trees near his home and knelt in prayer.
There are four accounts of the vision that followed, recorded by Joseph Smith or by scribes under his direction (see Gospel Topics Essays, “
First Vision Accounts
”).
In the account canonized as scripture, he described his experience as follows:
Image
The First Vision, by Linda Christensen and Michael Malm
“I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. … When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air.
One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—
This is My Beloved Son.
Hear Him!
” (
Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17
).
In this vision, God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith.
The Savior told him not to join any of the churches.
In another account of this vision, Joseph shared that the Savior also told him: “Thy sins are forgiven thee. … Behold I am the Lord of glory.
I was crucified for the world that all those who believe on my name may have Eternal life.”
After the vision, Joseph reflected, “My soul was filled with love, and for many days I could rejoice with great joy and the Lord was with me” (
Joseph Smith History, circa Summer 1832, 3, josephsmithpapers.org
; spelling and punctuation modernized).
Through this vision, Joseph Smith became a witness of Jesus Christ and learned important truths about the Godhead.
For example, he learned that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are separate beings.
When They called him by name, he learned that They knew him personally.
When Joseph was told that he was forgiven, he learned that God was merciful.
This experience filled him with joy.
As God had done with many previous prophets, He called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel would be restored to the earth.
This restoration would help God’s children find joy in this world and eternal life in the world to come—all through Jesus Christ.
Memorize
Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17
Memorize Joseph Smith’s description of seeing the Father and the Son (
Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17
).
Always be ready to describe the First Vision using Joseph Smith’s own words.
Bear sincere testimony of its truth and why it is important to you.
Restoration of the Priesthood and Priesthood Keys
Image
Upon You My Fellow Servants, by Linda Curley Christensen and Michael Malm
After the appearance of the Father and the Son, other heavenly messengers were sent to Joseph Smith and his associate Oliver Cowdery.
John the Baptist appeared as a resurrected being and conferred the Aaronic Priesthood and its keys on them.
The Aaronic Priesthood includes the authority to baptize.
Image
The Voice of Peter, James, and John, by Welden C.
Andersen
Soon afterward, Peter, James, and John—three of Christ’s original Apostles—appeared as resurrected beings and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood and its keys on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery.
This priesthood is the same authority that Christ gave His Apostles anciently.
Image
Image of Moses Elias and Elijah descending into the Kirtland temple and appearing to Joseph Smith.
In the Kirtland Temple, Moses, Elias, and Elijah appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and committed to them the further authority and priesthood keys necessary to accomplish God’s work in the latter days.
Moses committed the keys of the gathering of Israel.
Elias committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham.
Elijah committed the keys of the sealing power. (See
Doctrine and Covenants 110:11–16
; see also
General Handbook
,
3.1
.)
Organization of the Church
Joseph Smith was directed to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again on the earth.
Through him, Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles.
Prophets in biblical times referred to the time in which we live as the last days or the latter days.
It is the time soon before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.
That is why the Church is named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (see
Doctrine and Covenants 115:3–4
; see also
3 Nephi 27:3–8
).
Living Prophets and Apostles Today
Just as Jesus called Apostles during His mortal ministry to lead His Church, He has called Apostles to lead it today.
The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are prophets, seers, and revelators.
Only the senior Apostle is called
the
prophet because he presides over the entire Church and is uniquely authorized to speak for the Lord.
He is the authorized successor to Joseph Smith.
He and the present Apostles trace their authority to Jesus Christ in an unbroken chain of ordinations that began when Joseph Smith was ordained under the hands of the heavenly messengers.

The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ
The Book of Mormon is an ancient volume of holy scripture like the Bible.
The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ, and the Book of Mormon is a second witness of His ministry, His teachings, and His mission as our Savior.
Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly messenger named Moroni to a hill where an ancient record had been buried for centuries.
This record, inscribed on gold plates (thin sheets of metal), contained the writings of prophets about God’s dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas.
Joseph Smith translated this record by the gift and power of God.
The prophets in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of Jesus Christ and taught His gospel.
After Jesus was resurrected, He appeared to these people and ministered personally to them.
He taught them and established His Church.
The Book of Mormon helps us draw closer to God as we learn, understand, and apply its teachings.
The Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man [or woman] would get nearer to God by abiding by [the book’s] precepts, than by any other book” (
Teachings: Joseph Smith
,
64
).
Image
man reading
To know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, we need to read it, ponder it, and pray about it.
A Book of Mormon prophet promised that God would reveal the truth of the book to us as we pray with a sincere heart, with real intent, and with faith in Christ (see
Moroni 10:3–5
).
Studying the Book of Mormon is essential for enduring conversion.
As we read the Book of Mormon and pray about it, we will learn truths about Jesus Christ that will bless our lives.
We will also come to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ have been restored through him.

President Russell M.
Nelson
“I promise that as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon
every day
, you will make better decisions—
every day
.
I promise that as you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life.
I promise that as you daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized against the evils of the day” (Russell M.

Teaching Insights
Introducing the Book of Mormon to People
When introducing the Book of Mormon to people, explain that it is a sacred record of God’s interactions with some of the people in the ancient Americas for more than a thousand years.
From it we can learn much that applies to our lives today.
Explain that the purpose of the Book of Mormon is to convince all people that Jesus is the Christ (see the
title page
).
As its subtitle says, the book is “another testament of Jesus Christ.” Promise people that they can come to know their Savior better as they read it.
When you give people a copy of the Book of Mormon, tell them about the spiritual power it has brought into your life.
Share one or two passages that are meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to them.
In your personal and companion study, the Spirit will help you find verses that can lift and strengthen people.
Encourage people to read from the Book of Mormon every day.
As they read it and apply its precepts, they will be blessed and feel closer to God.
The Book of Mormon Confirms the Truth of the Restoration
You might use wording like the following to help people understand how the Book of Mormon confirms the truth of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ:
“The Book of Mormon is one way God has confirmed to me the truth of what we have said.
Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?”
Explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs.
Invite those you teach to read portions of the Book of Mormon and to apply the principles in these paragraphs.
As they feel the spirit and truth of the Book of Mormon, they can come to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.

Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost
Because God is our Father, He will help us recognize truth.
We can know that the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ is true as we read the Book of Mormon and pray to God.
When we pray with faith and real intent, He will answer our questions and guide our lives.
God usually answers our prayers through the Holy Ghost.
As we pray, the Holy Ghost teaches and confirms truth.
Communications from the Holy Ghost are powerful.
They usually come as a quiet assurance through our feelings, thoughts, and impressions (see
1 Kings 19:11–12
;
Helaman 5:30
;
Doctrine and Covenants 8:2
).
Consistent study of the scriptures (particularly the Book of Mormon), weekly sacrament meeting attendance, and sincere prayer help us feel the power of the Holy Ghost and discover truth.
Teaching Insights
Prayer
Like Joseph Smith, many people are searching for answers to important questions and for a connection to God.
Share how prayer has helped you feel close to God.
Share how you have received answers and guidance through study and prayer.
Explain that prayer is a two-way communication with God.
Invite those you teach to ask God for help and direction.
Inviting people to pray is one of the most important invitations you can extend.
As they receive answers, they will come to know that they are beloved children of God and that He will help them.
Many of the people you teach will lack experience with prayer.
It is a privilege for you to help them learn to pray and bring the blessings of prayer into their lives.
Prayer is how we gain a witness of spiritual truths.
Teach people that prayer normally consists of the following parts:
Begin by addressing your Heavenly Father.
Express the feelings of your heart, such as gratitude for the blessings you have received.
Ask questions, seek guidance, and ask for blessings you need.
End by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.”
Invite people to pray as they read the Book of Mormon to help them understand that it is the word of God and testifies of Jesus Christ.
When teaching people to pray, use simple language that they can also use when they pray.
Keep these prayers brief.
Invite the person you are teaching to offer a prayer at the end of the lesson.
Testify that God hears and answers our prayers.
Real Intent
Reading with real intent means being willing to act on the doctrine and incorporate it into daily life.
Praying with real intent means being willing to act on the answers we receive from God.

People May Wonder
What is the purpose of life?
Where did I come from?
Is there a God who cares about me?
How can I feel that He cares?
How can I believe in God when so many bad things happen?
Why is life so hard sometimes?
How can I find strength during these times?
How can I become a better person?
What happens after I die?
The restored gospel of Jesus Christ helps us answer important questions of the soul.
Through the gospel, we learn about our divine identity and our eternal potential as children of God.
The gospel gives us hope and helps us find peace, happiness, and meaning.
Living the gospel helps us grow and find strength as we face life’s challenges.
God wants the best for His children and desires to give us His greatest blessings, which are immortality and eternal life (see
Moses 1:39
;
Doctrine and Covenants 14:7
).
Because He loves us, He has provided a plan for us to receive these blessings.
In the scriptures, this plan is called the plan of salvation, the great plan of happiness, and the plan of redemption (see
Alma 42:5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 31
).
In God’s plan, each of us makes a journey through premortal life, birth, mortal life, death, and life after death.
God has provided what we need during this journey so that after we die, we can eventually return to His presence and receive a fulness of joy.
Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan.
Through His Atonement and Resurrection, Jesus made it possible for each of us to receive immortality and eternal life.
During our life on earth, we do not remember our premortal life.
Nor do we fully understand life after death.
However, God has revealed many truths about these parts of our eternal journey.
These truths provide sufficient knowledge for us to understand the purpose of life, to experience joy, and to have the hope of good things to come.
This knowledge is a sacred treasure to guide us while we are on earth.

What You Might Teach People in 15–25 Minutes
Select one or more of the following principles about the plan of salvation to teach.
The doctrinal foundation for each principle is provided after this outline.
Premortal Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us
We are all spirit children of God.
He created us in His own image.
We lived with God before we were born on earth.
We are members of His family.
He knows and loves each of us.
God has provided a plan for our happiness and progress in this life and in eternity.
In our premortal life, we chose to follow God’s plan.
This meant coming to earth so we could take the next step in our eternal progression.
Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan.
He makes it possible for us to have immortality and eternal life.
The Creation
Under God’s direction, Jesus Christ created the earth.
The Fall of Adam and Eve
Adam and Eve were the first of God’s spirit children to come to earth.
God created their bodies and placed them in the Garden of Eden.
Adam and Eve transgressed, were cast out of the garden, and were separated from God’s presence.
This event is called the Fall.
After the Fall, Adam and Eve became mortal.
As mortals, they were able to learn, progress, and have children.
They also experienced sorrow, sin, and death.
The Fall was a step forward for humankind.
The Fall made it possible for us to be born on earth and progress in Heavenly Father’s plan.
Our Life on Earth
In God’s plan, we needed to come to earth to receive physical bodies, learn, and grow.
On earth, we learn to walk by faith.
However, Heavenly Father has not left us alone.
He has provided many gifts and guides to help us return to His presence.
The Atonement of Jesus Christ
Each of us sins, and each of us will die.
Because God loves us, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to redeem us from sin and death.
Because of Jesus’s atoning sacrifice, we can be forgiven and cleansed of our sins.
Our hearts can be changed for the better as we repent.
This makes it possible for us to return to God’s presence and receive a fulness of joy.
Because of Jesus’s Resurrection, we will all be resurrected after we die.
This means that each person’s spirit and body will be reunited, and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body.
Jesus Christ offers comfort, hope, and healing.
His atoning sacrifice is the ultimate expression of His love.
All that is unfair in life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
The Spirit World
When our physical body dies, our spirit continues to live in the spirit world.
This is a temporary state of learning and preparation before the Resurrection.
The gospel of Jesus Christ is taught in the spirit world, and we can continue to grow and progress.
The Resurrection, Salvation, and Exaltation
After our time in the spirit world, the Resurrection is the next step in our eternal journey.
The Resurrection is the reuniting of our spirit and body.
Each of us will be resurrected and have a perfected physical body.
We will live forever.
This is made possible by the Savior’s Atonement and Resurrection.
Judgment and Kingdoms of Glory
When we are resurrected, Jesus Christ will be our judge.
With very few exceptions, all of God’s children will receive a place in a kingdom of glory.
Although we will all be resurrected, we will not all receive the same eternal glory.
Jesus will judge us according to our faith, works, and repentance in mortality and in the spirit world.
We can return to live in God’s presence if we are faithful.
Questions You Might Ask People
The following questions are examples of what you might ask people.
These questions can help you have meaningful conversations and understand a person’s needs and perspective.
What do you feel is the purpose of life?
What brings you happiness?
What challenges do you need God to help you with?
What have you learned from the challenges you have faced?
What do you know about Jesus Christ?
How have His life and mission affected your life?
Invitations You Might Extend
Will you ask God in prayer to help you know that what we have taught is true? (See “
Teaching Insights: Prayer
” in the last section of lesson 1.)
Will you attend church with us this Sunday to learn more about what we have taught?
Will you read the Book of Mormon and pray to know that it is the word of God? (You might suggest specific chapters or verses.)
Will you follow Jesus’s example and be baptized? (See “
The Invitation to Be Baptized and Confirmed
,” which immediately precedes lesson 1.)
May we set a time for our next visit?

Premortal Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us
We Are God’s Children, and We Lived with Him before Our Birth
God is the Father of our spirits.
We are literally His children, created in His image.
Each of us has a divine nature as a child of God.
This knowledge can help us through difficult times and can inspire us to become our best.
We lived with God as His spirit children before we were born on earth.
We are members of His family.
Image
President M.
Russell Ballard
“There is one important identity we all share now and forever, one that we should never ever lose sight of, and one that we should be grateful for.
That is that you are and have always been a son or daughter of God with spiritual roots in eternity.
“… Understanding this truth—really understanding it and embracing it—is life changing.
It gives you an extraordinary identity that no one can ever take away from you.
But more than that, it should give you an enormous feeling of value and a sense of your infinite worth.
Finally, it provides you a divine, noble, and worthy purpose in life” (M. Russell Ballard, “
Children of Heavenly Father
” [Brigham Young University devotional, Mar. 3, 2020], 2, speeches.byu.edu).
We Chose to Come to Earth
Our Heavenly Father loves us and desires that we become like Him.
He is an exalted being with a glorified physical body.
In our premortal life, we learned that God has a plan for us to become like Him.
One part of His plan was that we would leave our heavenly home and come to earth to receive physical bodies.
We also needed to gain experience and develop faith during a time away from God’s presence.
We would not remember living with God.
However, He would provide what we needed so we could return to live with Him.
Agency, or the freedom and ability to choose, is an essential part of God’s plan for us.
In our premortal life, each of us chose to follow God’s plan and come to earth so we could take the next step in our eternal progression.
We understood that while we were here, we would have many new opportunities to grow and experience joy.
We also understood that we would face opposition.
We would experience temptation, trials, sorrow, and death.
In choosing to come to earth, we trusted in God’s love and help.
We trusted in His plan for our salvation.
Heavenly Father Chose Jesus Christ to Redeem Us
Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan.
Before coming to earth, we knew that we could not return to God’s presence on our own.
Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ, His firstborn Son, to make it possible for us to return to Him and have eternal life.
Jesus willingly accepted.
He agreed to come to earth and redeem us through His atoning sacrifice.
His Atonement and Resurrection would enable God’s purposes for us to be fulfilled.

Leaving the Garden of Eden, by Joseph Brickey
The Fall of Adam and Eve
Before the Fall
Adam and Eve were the first of Heavenly Father’s spirit children to come to earth.
God created their physical bodies in His own image and placed them in the Garden of Eden.
In the garden they were innocent, and God provided for their needs.
While Adam and Eve were in the garden, God commanded them not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
If they obeyed this commandment, they could remain in the garden.
However, they would not be able to progress by learning from the opposition and challenges of mortality.
They would not be able to know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain.
Satan tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and they chose to do so.
Because of this choice, they were cast out of the garden and separated from God’s presence.
This event is called the Fall.
After the Fall
After the Fall, Adam and Eve became mortal.
No longer in a state of innocence, they understood and experienced both good and evil.
They could use their agency to choose between them.
Because Adam and Eve faced opposition and challenges, they were able to learn and progress.
Because they experienced sorrow, they could also experience joy. (See
2 Nephi 2:22–25
.)
Despite their hardships, Adam and Eve felt that being mortal was a great blessing.
One blessing was that they could have children.
This provided the way for God’s other spirit children to come to earth and receive physical bodies.
Concerning the blessings of the Fall, both Adam and Eve rejoiced.
Eve said, “Were it not for our transgression we never should have had [children], and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient” (
Moses 5:11
; see also
verse 10
).
Doctrinal Insight: The Fall
The Fall was a necessary part of God’s plan for our salvation.
The Fall made it possible for us to come to earth and progress toward becoming like God (see
2 Nephi 2:25
).
The decision of Eve and then Adam to partake of the fruit and leave the Garden of Eden was a spiritually sensitive choice.
Generally, scriptures and prophets refer to this choice as a transgression, not a sin (see
Articles of Faith 1:2
;
2 Nephi 9:6
).
Some people incorrectly believe that all of us inherit the guilt of Adam and Eve’s transgression (referred to by some as “original sin”).
However, the Lord revealed that He “atoned for original guilt, wherein the sins of the parents cannot be answered upon the heads of the children” (
Moses 6:54
).
When first teaching about the Fall, explain it very simply.

Our Life on Earth
Many people wonder, “Why am I here on earth?” Our life on earth is an essential part of God’s plan for our eternal progression.
Our ultimate purpose is to prepare to return to God’s presence and receive a fulness of joy.
Outlined below are some of the ways that earth life prepares us for this.
Image

Receive a Physical Body
One purpose of coming to earth is to receive a physical body in which our spirit can dwell.
Our bodies are sacred, miraculous creations of God.
With physical bodies, we can do, learn, and experience many things that our spirits could not.
We can progress in ways that we could not as spirits.
Because our bodies are mortal, we experience pain, disease, and other trials.
These experiences can help us learn patience, compassion, and other divine qualities.
They can be part of our path to joy.
Choosing the right when it is hard to do is often how faith, hope, and charity become parts of our character.
Learn to Use Agency Wisely
Another purpose of mortality is to learn to use our agency wisely—to choose what is right.
Learning to use our agency wisely is essential to becoming like God.
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ teach us what is right and give commandments to guide us to happiness.
Satan tempts us to do wrong, wanting us to be miserable as he is.
We face opposition between good and evil, which is necessary in learning to use our agency (see
2 Nephi 2:11
).
As we obey God, we grow and receive His promised blessings.
When we disobey, we distance ourselves from Him and receive the consequences of sin.
Although it sometimes appears otherwise, sin eventually leads to unhappiness.
Often the blessings of obedience—and the effects of sin—are not immediately evident or outwardly visible.
But they are sure, for God is just.
Even when we do our best, we all sin and “come short of the glory of God” (
Romans 3:23
).
Knowing this, Heavenly Father provided a way for us to repent so we can return to Him.
Repentance brings the power of our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, into our lives (see
Helaman 5:11
).
As we repent, we become cleansed from sin through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the gift of the Holy Ghost (see
3 Nephi 27:16–20
).
Through repentance, we experience joy.
The way back to our Heavenly Father is opened to us, for He is merciful. (See “
Repentance
” in lesson 3.)
Learn to Walk by Faith
Another purpose of this life is to gain experience that can come only through separation from Heavenly Father.
Because we do not see Him, we need to learn to walk by faith (see
2 Corinthians 5:6–7
).
God has not left us alone on this journey.
He has provided the Holy Ghost to guide, strengthen, and sanctify us.
He has also provided scriptures, prophets, prayer, and the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Every part of our mortal experience—the joys and sorrows, the successes and setbacks—can help us grow as we prepare to return to God.

The Atonement of Jesus Christ
Because of the Fall of Adam and Eve, we are all subject to sin and death.
We cannot overcome the effects of sin and death by ourselves.
In our Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation, He provided a way to overcome the effects of the Fall so we can return to Him.
Before the world was created, He chose Jesus Christ to be our Savior and Redeemer.
Only Jesus Christ could redeem us from sin and death.
He is the literal Son of God.
He lived a sinless life, completely obedient to His Father.
He was prepared and willing to do Heavenly Father’s will.
The Savior’s Atonement included His suffering in Gethsemane, His suffering and death on the cross, and His Resurrection.
He suffered beyond comprehension—so much that He bled from every pore (see
Doctrine and Covenants 19:18
).
Jesus Christ’s Atonement is the most glorious event in all human history.
Through His atoning sacrifice, Jesus made the Father’s plan operative.
We would be helpless without the Atonement of Jesus Christ because we cannot save ourselves from sin and death (see
Alma 22:12–15
).
Our Savior’s sacrifice was a supreme expression of love for His Father and for us. “The breadth, and length, and depth, and height” of Christ’s love surpass our understanding (
Ephesians 3:18
; see also
verse 19
).
Image
The Crucifixion, by Harry Anderson
Jesus Christ Overcame Death for All
When Jesus Christ died on the cross, His spirit was separated from His body.
On the third day, His spirit and His body were reunited, never to be separated again.
He appeared to many people, showing them that He had an immortal body of flesh and bones.
This reuniting of spirit and body is called the Resurrection.
As mortals, each of us will die.
However, because Jesus triumphed over death, every person born on earth will be resurrected.
The Resurrection is a divine gift for all, given through the Savior’s mercy and redeeming grace.
Each person’s spirit and body will be reunited, and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body.
If not for Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father (see
2 Nephi 9:8–12
).
Jesus Makes It Possible for Us to Be Cleansed of Our Sins
To understand the hope we can receive through Christ, we need to understand the law of justice.
This is the unchanging law that brings consequences for our actions.
Obedience to God brings positive consequences, and disobedience brings negative ones. (See
Alma 42:14–18
.) When we sin, we become spiritually unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see
3 Nephi 27:19
).
Image
Jesus Praying in Gethsemane, by Harry Anderson
During Jesus Christ’s atoning sacrifice, He stood in our place, suffered, and paid the penalty for our sins (see
3 Nephi 27:16–20
).
God’s plan gives Jesus Christ power to make intercession on our behalf—to stand between us and justice (see
Mosiah 15:9
).
Because of Jesus’s atoning sacrifice, He can claim His rights of mercy on our behalf as we exercise faith unto repentance (see
Moroni 7:27
;
Doctrine and Covenants 45:3–5
). “Thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles [us] in the arms of safety” (
Alma 34:16
).
Only through the gift of the Savior’s Atonement and our repentance can we return to live with God.
As we repent, we are forgiven and spiritually cleansed.
We are relieved of the burden of guilt for our sins.
Our wounded souls are healed.
We are filled with joy (see
Alma 36:24
).
Although we are imperfect and may fall short again, there is more grace, love, and mercy in Jesus Christ than there is failure, flaw, or sin in us.
God is always ready and eager to embrace us as we turn to Him and repent (see
Luke 15:11–32
).
Nothing and no one “shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (
Romans 8:39
).
Jesus Took upon Himself Our Pains, Afflictions, and Infirmities
In His atoning sacrifice, Jesus Christ took upon Himself our pains, afflictions, and infirmities.
Because of this, He knows “according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities” (
Alma 7:12
; see also
verse 11
).
He invites, “Come unto me,” and as we do, He gives us rest, hope, strength, perspective, and healing (
Matthew 11:28
; see also
verses 29–30
).
As we rely on Jesus Christ and His Atonement, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain.
We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation.
All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

The Spirit World
Many people wonder, “What happens after I die?” The plan of salvation provides some important answers to this question.
Death is part of God’s “merciful plan” for us (
2 Nephi 9:6
).
Rather than the end of our existence, death is the next step in our eternal progression.
To become like God, we must experience death and later receive perfected, resurrected bodies.
When our physical body dies, our spirit continues to live in the spirit world.
This is a temporary state of learning and preparation before the Resurrection and Final Judgment.
Our knowledge from mortal life remains with us.
In the spirit world, people who accepted and lived the gospel of Jesus Christ “are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise” (
Alma 40:12
).
Little children are also received into paradise when they die.
The spirits in paradise will be at peace from their troubles and sorrows.
They will continue their spiritual growth, doing God’s work and ministering to others.
They will teach the gospel to those who did not receive it during their mortal life (see
Doctrine and Covenants 138:32–37, 57–59
).
In the spirit world, people who were not able to receive the gospel on earth, or who chose not to follow the commandments, will experience some limitations (see
Doctrine and Covenants 138:6–37
;
Alma 40:6–14
).
However, because God is just and merciful, they will have an opportunity to be taught the gospel of Jesus Christ.
If they accept it and repent, they will be redeemed from their sins (see
Doctrine and Covenants 138:58
; see also
138:31–35
;
128:22
).
They will be welcomed into the peace of paradise.
They will eventually receive a place in a kingdom of glory based on the choices they made in mortality and in the spirit world.
We remain in the spirit world until we are resurrected.

The Resurrection, Salvation, and Exaltation
Resurrection
God’s plan makes it possible for us to grow and receive eternal life.
After our time in the spirit world, the Resurrection is our next step in that growth.
The Resurrection is the reuniting of our body and spirit.
Each of us will be resurrected.
This is made possible by the Savior’s Atonement and Resurrection. (See
Alma 11:42–44
.)
When we are resurrected, we will each have a perfected physical body, free of pain and sickness.
We will be immortal, living forever.
Salvation
Because we will all be resurrected, we will all be saved—or gain salvation—from physical death.
This gift is given to us through the grace of Jesus Christ.
We can also be saved—or gain salvation—from the consequences that the law of justice requires for our sins.
This gift is also made possible through the merits and mercy of Jesus Christ as we repent. (See
Alma 42:13–15, 21–25
.)
Exaltation
Exaltation, or eternal life, is the highest state of happiness and glory in the celestial kingdom.
Exaltation is a conditional gift.
President Russell M.
Nelson taught, “Those qualifying conditions include faith in the Lord, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and remaining faithful to the ordinances and covenants of the temple” (“
Salvation and Exaltation
,”
Ensign
or
Liahona
, May 2008, 9).
Exaltation means living with God forever in eternal families.
It is to know God and Jesus Christ, to become like Them, and to experience the life They enjoy.

Judgment and Kingdoms of Glory
Note:
When first teaching about the kingdoms of glory, teach at a basic level according to a person’s needs and understanding.
When we are resurrected, Jesus Christ will be our just and merciful judge.
With very few exceptions, each of us will receive a place in a kingdom of glory.
Although we will all be resurrected, we will not all receive the same eternal glory (see
Doctrine and Covenants 88:22–24, 29–34
;
130:20–21
;
132:5
).
Individuals who did not have the opportunity to fully understand and obey God’s laws during their mortal life will be given that opportunity in the spirit world.
Jesus will judge each person according to his or her faith, works, desires, and repentance in mortality and in the spirit world (see
Doctrine and Covenants 138:32–34, 57–59
).
The scriptures teach of celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdoms of glory.
Each of them is a manifestation of God’s love, justice, and mercy.
Those who exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, receive the ordinances of the gospel, keep their covenants, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end will be saved in the celestial kingdom.
This kingdom will also include people who did not have the opportunity to receive the gospel during their mortal life but “would have received it with all their hearts” and did so in the spirit world (
Doctrine and Covenants 137:8
; see also
verse 7
).
Children who died before the age of accountability (eight years old) will also be saved in the celestial kingdom (see
Doctrine and Covenants 137:10
).
In the scriptures, the celestial kingdom is compared to the glory or brightness of the sun. (See
Doctrine and Covenants 76:50–70
.)
People who lived honorable lives “who received not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it” will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom (
Doctrine and Covenants 76:74
).
The same is true for those who were not valiant in their testimony of Jesus.
This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon. (See
Doctrine and Covenants 76:71–80
.)
Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life or accept the gospel of Jesus Christ in the spirit world will receive their reward in the telestial kingdom.
This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars. (See
Doctrine and Covenants 76:81–86
.)
Doctrinal Insight: Judgment
Every person will stand before Jesus Christ to “be judged according to their works” (
3 Nephi 27:15
; see
verses 13–15
).
The Lord will take into account each person’s unique circumstances, including his or her knowledge of good and evil, understanding of the gospel, degree of accountability, and desires (see
Luke 12:47–48
;
Doctrine and Covenants 137:9
).
Because we do not fully understand the circumstances of others, we should refrain from making judgments about the kingdom of glory they will receive.
Rather, we are to prepare ourselves to meet the Lord and invite others to prepare. (See
Alma 5:15–19, 33
;

The Second Coming, by Harry Anderson
People May Wonder
Who is Jesus Christ?
How can He help me and my family?
What does it mean to have faith in Jesus Christ?
How can having faith in Him bless my life?
What does it mean to repent?
How can I feel God’s peace and forgiveness after I’ve made bad choices?
What is the purpose of baptism?
What is the gift of the Holy Ghost?
What does it mean to endure to the end?
The gospel of Jesus Christ is how we come unto Christ.
It is simple enough that a child can understand it.
This lesson focuses on the gospel and doctrine of Christ, including faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
It also focuses on how the gospel blesses all of God’s children.
The word
gospel
literally means “good news.” The gospel of Jesus Christ is good news because it provides the doctrine—the eternal truth—we need to come unto Him and be saved (see
1 Nephi 15:14
).
The gospel teaches us how to live good, meaningful lives.
The good news of the gospel provides the way for us to be forgiven of sins, be sanctified, and return to God’s presence.
Teaching Insight: The Gospel of Christ and the Doctrine of Christ
The gospel of Jesus Christ includes all the doctrine, principles, laws, commandments, ordinances, and covenants necessary for our salvation and exaltation.
The gospel message is that we can access the saving, redeeming power of Jesus Christ.
We do this by exercising faith in Him, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end (see
Articles of Faith 1:4
).
This is also known as the doctrine of Christ.
Living this doctrine is how we come unto Christ and are saved (see
1 Nephi 15:14
).
This is powerfully taught in the Book of Mormon (see
2 Nephi 31
;
32:1–6
;
3 Nephi 11:31–40
;
27:13–22
).
Your purpose is to help people come unto Christ by helping them live His doctrine.

What You Might Teach People in 15–25 Minutes
Select one or more of the following principles to teach.
The doctrinal foundation for each principle is provided after this outline.
The Divine Mission of Jesus Christ
God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to redeem us from sin and death.
Because of Jesus’s atoning sacrifice, we can be cleansed of our sins and sanctified as we repent.
After Jesus was crucified, He was resurrected.
Because of His Resurrection, we will all be resurrected after we die.
This means that each person’s spirit and body will be reunited, and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body.
Faith in Jesus Christ
Faith is the first principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Faith in Jesus Christ includes having confidence that He is the Son of God and trusting in Him as our Savior and Redeemer.
Faith in Jesus Christ is a principle of action and power.
We strengthen our faith by praying, studying the scriptures, and obeying the commandments.
Repentance
Faith in Jesus Christ leads us to repent.
Repentance is the process of turning to God and turning away from sin.
As we repent, our actions, desires, and thoughts change to be more in harmony with God’s will.
When we sincerely repent, God forgives us.
Forgiveness is possible because Jesus Christ atoned for our sins.
As we repent, we feel peace as our guilt and sorrow are healed.
Repentance is a lifelong process.
God welcomes us back every time we repent.
He will never give up on us.
Baptism: Our First Covenant with God
Baptism is how we first enter a covenant relationship with God.
Baptism has two parts: baptism by water and by the Spirit.
When we are baptized and confirmed, we are cleansed of our sins, giving us a new start in life.
We are baptized by immersion, following Jesus’s example.
Children are not baptized until they are eight years old.
Children who die before that age are redeemed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
We partake of the sacrament each week in remembrance of Jesus’s sacrifice and to renew our covenants with God.
The Gift of the Holy Ghost
The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead.
After we are baptized, we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost through the ordinance of confirmation.
When we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, we can have His companionship throughout our lives if we are faithful.
The Holy Ghost sanctifies us, guides us, comforts us, and helps us know the truth.
Endure to the End
Enduring includes continuing to exercise faith in Christ each day.
We continue to keep our covenants with God, repent, seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost, and partake of the sacrament.
As we faithfully seek to follow Jesus Christ, God promises that we will have eternal life.
The Gospel of Jesus Christ Blesses All of God’s Children
Living the gospel deepens our joys, inspires our actions, and enriches our relationships.
We are most likely to be happy—both as individuals and as families—when we live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Through the gospel of Jesus Christ, families are blessed in this life and can be united for eternity and live in the presence of God.
Questions You Might Ask People
The following questions are examples of what you might ask people.
These questions can help you have meaningful conversations and understand a person’s needs and perspective.
What do you know about Jesus Christ?
What does it mean to you to have faith in Jesus Christ?
What changes do you want to make in your life?
What is your understanding of repentance?
What is your understanding of baptism?
What can you do now to prepare for baptism?
How could the Holy Ghost help you in your journey to return to God’s presence?
What is a challenge that you or your family is facing?
May we share some ways the gospel of Jesus Christ could help?

These Twelve Jesus Sent Forth, by Walter Rane
The Divine Mission of Jesus Christ
Heavenly Father sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to make it possible for all of us to experience joy in this world and eternal life in the world to come. “And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, … that [Jesus Christ] came into the world … to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness; that through him all might be saved” (
Doctrine and Covenants 76:40–42
).
As mortals, we all sin, and we all die.
Sin and death would prevent us from having eternal life with God unless we had a Redeemer (see
2 Nephi 9
).
Before the world was created, Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ to redeem us.
In a supreme expression of love, Jesus came to earth and fulfilled this divine mission.
He made it possible for us to be redeemed from our sins, and He ensured that we will all be resurrected after we die.
Jesus lived a sinless life.
At the end of His mortal ministry, He took upon Himself our sins by His suffering in Gethsemane and when He was crucified (see
1 Nephi 11:33
).
Jesus’s suffering was so great that it caused Him “to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore” (
Doctrine and Covenants 19:18
).
After His Crucifixion, Jesus was resurrected, gaining victory over death.
Together, these events are the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
Our sins make us spiritually unclean, and “no unclean thing can dwell with God” (
1 Nephi 10:21
).
In addition, the law of justice requires a consequence for our sins.
Jesus’s atoning sacrifice provides the way for us to become cleansed of sin and sanctified as we repent.
It also provides the way to satisfy the demands of justice (see
Alma 42:15, 23–24
).
The Savior said, “I … have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; but if they would not repent they must suffer even as I” (
Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–17
).
If not for Jesus Christ, sin would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father.
In offering Himself as a sacrifice for us, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility.
We need to have faith in Him, repent, and strive to obey the commandments.
As we repent, Jesus will claim on our behalf His rights of mercy of His Father (see
Moroni 7:27–28
).
Because of the Savior’s intercession, Heavenly Father forgives us, relieving us of the burden and guilt of our sins (see
Mosiah 15:7–9
).
We are spiritually cleansed and can ultimately be welcomed into God’s presence.
Jesus’s divine mission was also to save us from death.
Because He was resurrected, we will all be resurrected after we die.
This means that each person’s spirit and body will be reunited, and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body.
If not for Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father.

Faith in Jesus Christ
The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Faith is the foundation for all other gospel principles.
Faith in Jesus Christ includes having confidence that He is the Only Begotten Son of God.
It includes trusting in Him as our Savior and Redeemer—that He is our only way to return to God’s presence (see
Acts 4:10–12
;
Mosiah 3:17
;
4:6–8
).
We are invited to exercise “unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save” (
2 Nephi 31:19
).
Faith in Jesus Christ includes believing that He suffered for our sins in His atoning sacrifice.
Because of His sacrifice, we can be cleansed and redeemed as we repent.
This cleansing helps us find peace and hope in this life.
It also allows us to receive a fulness of joy after we die.
Faith in Jesus Christ includes trusting that through Him, we will all be resurrected after we die.
This faith can sustain and comfort us in times of loss.
The sorrow of death can be dispelled by the promise of the Resurrection.
Faith in Jesus Christ includes believing and trusting that He took upon Himself our afflictions and infirmities (see
Isaiah 53:3–5
).
He knows by His experience how to mercifully support us through life’s challenges (see
Alma 7:11–12
;
Doctrine and Covenants 122:8
).
As we exercise faith, He helps us press forward through hardships.
Through our faith in Him, Jesus can heal us physically and spiritually.
He is always ready to help us as we remember His invitation to “look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not” (
Doctrine and Covenants 6:36
).
A Principle of Action and Power
Faith in Jesus Christ leads to action.
We express our faith by obeying the commandments and doing good each day.
We repent of our sins.
We are loyal to Him.
We strive to become more like Him.
As we exercise faith, we can experience Jesus’s power in our daily lives.
He will magnify our own best efforts.
He will help us grow and resist temptation.
Strengthening Our Faith
The prophet Alma taught that building faith can begin with a simple “desire to believe” (
Alma 32:27
).
Then, for our faith in Jesus Christ to grow, we need to nurture it by learning His words, applying His teachings, and obeying His commandments.
Alma taught that as we patiently, diligently nurture the word of God in our hearts, “it shall take root [and become like] a tree springing up unto everlasting life”—thus strengthening our faith (
Alma 32:41
; see
verses 26–43
).

Repentance
What Is Repentance?
Repentance is the second principle of the gospel.
Faith in Jesus Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent (see
Helaman 14:13
).
Repentance is the process of turning to God and turning away from sin.
As we repent, our actions, desires, and thoughts change to be more in harmony with God’s will.
Forgiveness of sin is made possible through Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.
Repentance is much more than exercising willpower to change a behavior or overcome a weakness.
Repentance is sincerely turning to Christ, who gives us the power to experience a “mighty change” in our hearts (
Alma 5:12–14
).
As we experience this change of heart, we are spiritually reborn (see
Mosiah 27:24–26
).
Through repentance, we develop a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world.
We feel anew God’s love for us as His children—and our Savior’s love for us.
The opportunity to repent is one of the greatest blessings God has given us through His Son.
Process of Repentance
When we repent, we recognize our sins and feel genuine remorse.
We confess our sins to God and ask for His forgiveness.
We also confess very serious sins to authorized Church leaders, who will support us as we repent.
We do what we can to make restitution, which means trying to correct the problems our actions may have caused.
Genuine repentance is best demonstrated by righteous actions over a period of time.
Repentance is a daily process throughout our lives. “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (
Romans 3:23
).
We should continually repent, remembering that we “can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth” us (
Philippians 4:13
).
The Lord has assured us that “as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses” (
Mosiah 26:30
).
Blessings of Repentance
Repentance is a positive principle that brings joy and peace.
It brings us “unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of [our] souls” (
Helaman 5:11
).
When we repent, our guilt and sorrow are healed in process of time.
We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance.
Our desire to follow God grows stronger.

“Too many people consider repentance as punishment—something to be avoided. … But this feeling of being penalized is engendered by Satan.
He tries to block us from looking to Jesus Christ, who stands with open arms, hoping and willing to heal, forgive, cleanse, strengthen, purify, and sanctify us” (Russell M.

Baptism: Our First Covenant with God
Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation.
Baptism is the first saving ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
As we receive this joyous ordinance of hope, we make our first covenant with God.
An ordinance is a sacred act or ceremony performed by the authority of the priesthood.
Some ordinances, like baptism, are essential to our salvation.
Through ordinances, we make covenants with God.
These covenants are sacred promises between us and God.
He promises to bless us as we keep our promises with Him.
We should have a strong commitment to keep our promises with God.
God has provided ordinances and covenants to help us come unto Him and have eternal life.
As we receive priesthood ordinances and keep the associated covenants, we can experience “the power of godliness” in our lives (
Doctrine and Covenants 84:20
).
The Baptismal Covenant
The Savior taught that baptism is necessary for us to enter the kingdom of heaven (see
John 3:5
).
It is also necessary for us to become members of the Church of Jesus Christ.
Our Savior set the example by being baptized (see
Matthew 3:13–17
).
When we are baptized and keep our covenant, God promises to forgive our sins (see
Acts 22:16
;
3 Nephi 12:1–2
).
This great blessing is made possible through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who “loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood” (
Revelation 1:5
).
God also promises to bless us with the companionship of the Holy Ghost so we can be sanctified, guided, and comforted.
In our part of the baptismal covenant, we witness that we are willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ.
We also promise to always remember Him and keep His commandments.
We promise to love and serve others, “to mourn with those that mourn; … comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (
Mosiah 18:9
; see
verses 8–10, 13
).
We express a determination to serve Jesus Christ to the end of our lives (see
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
;
Mosiah 2:17
).
Our covenant commitments associated with baptism are a great responsibility.
They are also inspiring and joyful.
They create a special relationship between us and Heavenly Father through which He perpetually extends His love.
Baptism by Immersion
Jesus taught that we need to be baptized by immersion for a remission of our sins (see
Doctrine and Covenants 20:72–74
).
Baptism by immersion is symbolic of the death, burial, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ (see
Romans 6:3–6
).
Baptism by immersion also has powerful symbolism for us personally.
It represents the death of our old life, the burial of that life, and our emergence in spiritual rebirth.
When we are baptized, we begin the process of being born again and becoming spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see
Mosiah 5:7–8
;
Romans 8:14–17
).
Children
Children are not baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see
Doctrine and Covenants 68:27
).
Children who die before that age are redeemed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see
Moroni 8:4–24
;
Doctrine and Covenants 137:10
).
Before children are baptized, they should be taught the gospel so they will be prepared for this important step in their lives to make a covenant with God.
The Sacrament
Our Heavenly Father wants us to be faithful to the covenants we make with Him.
To help us do this, He has commanded us to meet often to partake of the sacrament.
The sacrament is a priesthood ordinance that Jesus introduced to His Apostles just before His Atonement.
Partaking of the sacrament is the central purpose of sacrament meeting each week.
Bread and water are blessed and passed to the congregation.
The bread represents the Savior’s sacrifice of His body for us.
The water represents His blood, which He shed for us.
We partake of these emblems in remembrance of the Savior’s sacrifice and to renew our covenants with God.
We receive anew the promise that the Spirit will be with us.
Before Baptism
Before those you teach are baptized, they should have developed faith in Christ, repented, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify for baptism as indicated in
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
.
They should also commit to keep the commandments and live the gospel of Jesus Christ.
If you have set a baptismal date but a person needs additional preparation, postpone the baptism until he or she is ready.
See
chapter 12
.
Before baptism, each person should:
Receive all the missionary lessons.
Meet the elders quorum president, Relief Society president, and bishop.
Attend several sacrament meetings.
Authority to Baptize
Some people who have been baptized in another church might wonder why they need to be baptized again.
Baptism and confirmation need to be performed by priesthood holders who have been ordained to perform those ordinances (see
Articles of Faith 1:5
;
Acts 19:1–6
;
Hebrews 5:4
).

The Gift of the Holy Ghost
Receiving the Gift of the Holy Ghost
Baptism has two parts.
Jesus taught that we need to be “born of water
and
of the Spirit” to enter the kingdom of God (
John 3:5
; emphasis added).
Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith
[2007],
95
).
Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit to be complete.
When we receive both baptisms, we are cleansed of our sins and are spiritually reborn.
We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ.
We receive the baptism of the Spirit through an ordinance called confirmation.
This ordinance is performed by one or more priesthood holders who lay their hands upon our head.
First they confirm us a member of the Church, and then they confer the gift of the Holy Ghost upon us.
This is the same ordinance that is referenced in the New Testament and the Book of Mormon (see
Acts 8:14–17
;
3 Nephi 18:36–37
).
The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead.
He works in unity with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
When we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, we can have His companionship throughout our lives as we are faithful.
How the Holy Ghost Blesses Us
The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of Heavenly Father’s greatest gifts.
The Holy Ghost cleanses and sanctifies us, making us more holy, more complete, more like God (see
3 Nephi 27:20
).
He helps us change and grow spiritually as we seek to follow God’s precepts.
The Holy Ghost helps us learn and recognize truth (see
Moroni 10:5
).
He also confirms truth to our hearts and minds.
Additionally, the Holy Ghost helps us teach truth (see
Doctrine and Covenants 42:14
).
When we learn and teach truth by the power of the Holy Ghost, He carries it unto our hearts (see
2 Nephi 33:1
).
As we humbly seek direction from the Holy Ghost, He will guide us (see
2 Nephi 32:5
).
This includes prompting us in how we can serve others.
The Holy Ghost provides spiritual strength to help us overcome weakness.
He helps us resist temptation.
He can warn us of spiritual and physical danger.
The Holy Ghost will help us through the challenges of life.
He will comfort us during times of trial or sorrow, filling us with hope (see
Moroni 8:26
).
Through the Holy Ghost, we can feel God’s love for us.
Guidance from the Holy Ghost
The people you are teaching have likely felt the influence of the Holy Ghost as you have met with them and as they have studied and prayed.
Explain that to continue to experience these good feelings, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend sacrament meeting, and obey the commandments.
Explain that being baptized and confirmed provides the blessing of having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost.
As needed, teach the person how to pray.
See “
Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost
” in lesson 1 and “
Pray Often
” in lesson 4 for guidance about helping someone learn to pray.

Endure to the End
When we are baptized and confirmed, we enter into a covenant with God.
Among other things, we promise to keep His commandments and serve Him for the remainder of our lives (see
Mosiah 18:8–10, 13
;
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
).
After we have entered the gospel path through baptism and confirmation, we make every effort to stay on it.
When we get off the path even a little bit, we exercise faith in Christ to repent.
The blessing of repentance allows us to return to the gospel path and retain the blessings of our covenants with God.
As we sincerely repent, God is always willing to forgive and welcome us back.
Enduring to the end means staying faithful to God to the end of our lives—through good times and hard times, through prosperity and adversity.
We humbly allow Christ to shape us and make us more like Him.
We look to Christ with faith, trust, and hope regardless of what comes in our lives.
Enduring to the end does not simply mean holding on until we die.
Instead, it means focusing our lives, thoughts, and actions on Jesus Christ.
It includes continuing to exercise faith in Christ each day.
We also continue to repent, keep our covenants with God, and seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost.
Enduring to the end includes “press[ing] forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.” Our Heavenly Father promises that as we endure to the end, we “shall have eternal life” (
2 Nephi 31:20
).

The Gospel of Jesus Christ Blesses All of God’s Children
The gospel of Jesus Christ is for all of God’s children.
The scriptures teach that “all are alike unto God” regardless of our background or situation.
He invites “all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him” (
2 Nephi 26:33
).
The gospel blesses us throughout our mortal lives and throughout eternity.
We are most likely to be happy—both as individuals and as families—when we live by the teachings of Jesus Christ (see
Mosiah 2:41
; “
The Family: A Proclamation to the World
,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org).
Living the gospel deepens our joys, inspires our actions, and enriches our relationships.
Living the gospel of Jesus Christ can also protect us from making choices that would harm us physically or spiritually.
It helps us find strength and comfort in times of trial and sorrow.
It provides the way to a joyous eternal life.
One of the great messages of the restored gospel is that we are all part of God’s family.
We are His beloved sons and daughters.
Regardless of our family situation on earth, each of us is a member of the family of God.
Another great part of our message is that families can be united for eternity.
The family is ordained of God.
Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness enables family relationships to continue beyond the grave.
Sacred temple ordinances and covenants make it possible for families to be together forever.
Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges.
Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
The gospel of Jesus Christ helps us develop stronger family relationships.
The home is the best place to teach and learn the principles of the gospel.
A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety.
It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide.
Sensitivity When Teaching about Families
When teaching about families, be sensitive if people are not married, are unable to have children, or have a strained relationship with family members.
Emphasize that God loves them as part of His family.
Help them see how the gospel blesses them personally regardless of their family circumstances.
As they are faithful, God will provide a way for them to have the blessings of loving families, whether in this life or in the life to come.

What You Might Teach People in 3–10 Minutes
God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to redeem us from sin and death.
Faith in Jesus Christ is a principle of action and power.
Faith helps us experience the Savior’s strengthening power in our lives.
Faith in Jesus Christ leads us to repent.
Repentance is the process of turning to God and turning away from sin.
As we repent, our actions, desires, and thoughts change to be more in harmony with God’s will.
When we repent, God forgives us.
Forgiveness is possible because Jesus Christ atoned for our sins.
Baptism has two parts: baptism by water and by the Spirit.
When we are baptized and confirmed, we are cleansed of our sins, giving us a new start in life.
After we are baptized by water, we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost through the ordinance of confirmation.
As we faithfully follow the gospel path to the end of our lives, God promises that we will have eternal life.

Teaching This Lesson
Baptism is a joyous ordinance of hope.
When we are baptized, we show our desire to follow God and enter the path leading to eternal life.
We also show our commitment to becoming lifelong disciples of Jesus Christ.
This lesson is organized according to the covenants we make at baptism.
It includes the following main sections, each of which has subsections:
Our Covenant to Be Willing to Take upon Us the Name of Jesus Christ

Our Covenant to Be Willing to Take upon Us the Name of Jesus Christ
When we are baptized, we covenant to follow Jesus Christ “with full purpose of heart.” We also witness that we “are willing to take upon [us] the name of Christ” (
2 Nephi 31:13
; see also
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
).
Taking upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ means that we remember Him and strive to live as His lifelong disciples.
We let His light shine through us to others.
We see ourselves as His and put Him first in our lives.
The following sections describe two ways we remember and follow Jesus Christ.
Pray Often
Prayer can be a simple conversation with Heavenly Father that comes from the heart.
In prayer, we speak with Him openly and honestly.
We express love for Him and gratitude for our blessings.
We also ask for help, protection, and direction.
As we close our prayers, we should take time to pause and listen.
Jesus taught, “Ye must always pray unto the Father
in my name
” (
3 Nephi 18:19
, emphasis added; see also
Moses 5:8
).
As we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, we remember both Him and Heavenly Father.
Jesus set the example for us to follow as we pray.
We can learn much about prayer by studying the Savior’s prayers in the scriptures (see
Matthew 6:9–13
;
John 17
).
Our prayers can include the following parts:
Begin by addressing Heavenly Father.
Express the feelings of our heart, such as gratitude for blessings we have received.
Ask questions, seek guidance, and ask for blessings.
End by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.”
The scriptures admonish us to pray in the morning and in the evening.
However, we can pray at any time and in any setting.
For our personal and family prayers, it can be meaningful to kneel when we pray.
We should always have a prayer in our hearts. (See
Alma 34:27
;
37:36–37
;
3 Nephi 17:13
;
19:16
.)
Our prayers should be thoughtful and from the heart.
When we pray, we should avoid saying the same things in the same ways.
We pray with faith, sincerity, and real intent to act on the answers we receive.
As we do this, God will guide us and help us make good decisions.
We will feel closer to Him.
He will grant us understanding and truth.
He will bless us with comfort, peace, and strength.

Invitation
Will you pray daily to Heavenly Father?
Study the Scriptures
Nephi taught, “Feast upon the words of Christ; for [they] will tell you all things what ye should do” (
2 Nephi 32:3
; see also
31:20
).
Studying the scriptures is an essential way to remember and follow Jesus Christ.
In the scriptures we learn of His life, ministry, and teachings.
We also learn of His promises.
As we read the scriptures, we experience His love.
Our souls expand, our faith in Him increases, and our minds are enlightened.
Our testimonies of His divine mission become stronger.
We remember and follow Jesus as we apply His words in our lives.
We should study the scriptures daily, especially the Book of Mormon.
The scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.
These are also called the “standard works.”

Our Covenant to Keep the Commandments of God
Note:
There are many ways to teach the commandments in this section.
For example, you might teach them in a few visits.
Or you could teach some of them as part of the first three lessons.
When teaching the commandments, be sure to connect them to the baptismal covenant and the plan of salvation.
When we are baptized, we covenant with God that we will “keep his commandments” (
Mosiah 18:10
;
Alma 7:15
).
God has given us commandments because He loves us.
He wants the best for us, both now and in eternity.
As our Heavenly Father, He knows what we need for our spiritual and physical well-being.
He also knows what will bring us the greatest happiness.
Each commandment is a divine gift, given to guide our decisions, protect us, and help us grow.
One reason we came to earth is to learn and grow through using our agency wisely (see
Abraham 3:25
).
Choosing to obey God’s commandments—and to repent when we fall short—helps us navigate this often challenging mortal journey.
The commandments of God are a source of strength and blessings (see
Doctrine and Covenants 82:8–9
).
By keeping the commandments, we learn that they are not burdensome rules that restrict our freedom.
True freedom comes from obeying the commandments.
Obedience is a source of strength that brings us light and knowledge through the Holy Ghost.
It brings us greater happiness and helps us reach our divine potential as children of God.
God promises to bless us as we keep His commandments.
Some blessings are specific to certain commandments.
His ultimate blessings are peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come. (See
Mosiah 2:41
;
Alma 7:16
;
Doctrine and Covenants 14:7
;
59:23
;
93:28
;
130:20–21
.)
God’s blessings are both spiritual and temporal.
At times, we need to be patient in waiting for them, trusting that they will come according to His will and timing (see
Mosiah 7:33
;
Doctrine and Covenants 88:68
).
To discern some blessings, we need to be spiritually attentive and observant.
This is especially true of blessings that come in simple and seemingly ordinary ways.
Some blessings might be evident only in hindsight.
Others might not come until after this life.
Regardless of the timing or nature of God’s blessings, we can be assured that they will come as we strive to live the gospel of Jesus Christ (see
Doctrine and Covenants 82:10
).
God loves all His children perfectly.
He is patient with our weakness, and He is forgiving when we repent.
The Two Great Commandments
When Jesus was asked, “Which is the great commandment?” He answered, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.”
Jesus then said the second great commandment is like unto the first: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (
Matthew 22:36–39
). “There is none other commandment greater than these” (
Mark 12:31
).
As God’s spirit children, we have a vast capacity for love.
It is part of our spiritual heritage.
Living the two great commandments—to love God first and to love our neighbor—is a defining characteristic of disciples of Jesus Christ.
Love of God
There are many ways we can show our love for God.
We can keep His commandments (see
John 14:15, 21
).
We can put Him first in our lives, submitting our will to His.
We can center our desires, thoughts, and hearts on Him (see
Alma 37:36
).
We can live in gratitude for the blessings He has given us—and be generous in sharing those blessings (see
Mosiah 2:21–24
;
4:16–21
).
Through prayer and service to others, we can express and deepen our love for Him.
Like other commandments, the commandment to love God is for our benefit.
What we love determines what we seek.
What we seek determines what we think and do.
And what we think and do determines who we are—and who we will become.
Love of Others
Loving others is an extension of our love for God.
The Savior taught us many ways to love others (see, for example,
Luke 10:25–37
and
Matthew 25:31–46
).
We reach out and welcome them into our hearts and lives.
We love by serving—by giving of ourselves even in small ways.
We love others by using the gifts that God has given us to bless them.
Loving others includes being patient, kind, and honest.
It includes forgiving freely.
It means treating all people with respect.
When we love someone, we and that person are both blessed.
Our hearts grow, our lives become more meaningful, and our joy increases.
Blessings
The two great commandments—to love God and love our neighbor—are the foundation of all of God’s commandments (see
Matthew 22:40
).
When we love God first, and also love others, everything in our lives will move into its proper place.
This love will affect our perspective, the use of our time, the interests we pursue, and the order of our priorities.

Follow the Prophet
God calls prophets to be His representatives on earth.
Through His prophets, He reveals truth and provides guidance and warnings.
God called Joseph Smith to be the first prophet of the latter days (see
lesson 1
).
Successors to Joseph Smith have likewise been called of God to lead His Church, including the prophet who leads it today.
We should gain a conviction of the divine calling of the living prophet and follow his teachings.
The teachings of the living prophets and apostles provide an anchor of eternal truth in a world of shifting values.
As we follow God’s prophets, the confusion and strife of the world will not overwhelm us.
We will find greater happiness in this life and receive guidance for this part of our eternal journey.

Keep the Ten Commandments
God revealed the Ten Commandments to an ancient prophet named Moses to guide his people.
These commandments apply just as much in our day.
They teach us to worship and show reverence for God.
They also teach us how to treat one another.
“Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (
Exodus 20:3
).
Other “gods” can include many things, such as possessions, power, or prominence.
“Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” (
Exodus 20:4
).
“Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain” (
Exodus 20:7
).
“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (

Teaching Insight: No Other Gods before Me
People in many cultures pay respect to objects that remind them of Deity or ancestors.
Sometimes those objects, such as statues, religious emblems, or small shrines, might also be the focus of their worship.
Help those you teach to focus their faith and worship on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.

Live the Law of Chastity
The law of chastity is a vital part of God’s plan for our salvation and exaltation.
Sexual intimacy between husband and wife is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love within marriage.
This intimacy and the power to create human life are intended to be beautiful and sacred.
God’s law of chastity is abstinence from sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between one man and one woman.
This law also means having complete fidelity and loyalty to a person’s spouse after marriage.
To help us keep the law of chastity, prophets have admonished us to be clean in our thoughts and words.
We should avoid pornography in any form.
In keeping with the law of chastity, we should be modest in our behavior and appearance.
Baptismal candidates are to live the law of chastity.
Repentance and Forgiveness
In God’s sight, breaking the law of chastity is very serious (see
Exodus 20:14
;
Ephesians 5:3
).
It misuses the sacred power that He has given to create life.
But He continues to love us even if we have broken this law.
He invites us to repent and become clean through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
The despair of sin can be replaced with the sweet peace of God’s forgiveness (see
Doctrine and Covenants 58:42–43
).
Blessings
God has given the law of chastity to bless us and the spirit children He sends to earth.
Obeying this law is essential to personal peace and to having love, trust, and unity in our family relationships.
As we live the law of chastity, we will be protected from the spiritual harm that comes from sexual intimacy outside of marriage.
We will also avoid the emotional and physical problems that often accompany such relations.
We will grow in our confidence before God (see
Doctrine and Covenants 121:45
).
We will be more open to the influence of the Holy Ghost.
We will be better prepared to make sacred covenants in the temple that unite our families for eternity.
Couples Living Together
A couple living together outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman may not be baptized until they live the law of chastity.
This means no longer living together—whether as a heterosexual couple or a same-sex couple—or, for a man and a woman, it means getting married.
It also includes exercising faith unto repentance as described in
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
.
Marriage between a man and a woman is an essential part of God’s plan.
The invitation to live the law of chastity may pose very difficult challenges to some people you are teaching.
Be prayerful and sensitive to each person’s situation.
Follow the promptings of the Spirit when teaching.
Use caution and do not discuss specific details.
As needed, seek counsel from your mission president for specific situations.

Keep the Law of Tithing
A great privilege of membership in the Church is the opportunity to pay tithing.
As we tithe, we help further God’s work and bless His children.
The law of tithing has origins in Old Testament times.
For example, the prophet Abraham paid tithes of all he possessed (see
Alma 13:15
;
Genesis 14:18–20
).
The word
tithe
literally means one-tenth.
As we tithe, we donate one-tenth of our income to the Church (see
Doctrine and Covenants 119:3–4
;
interest
is understood to mean income).
All that we have is a gift from God.
When we pay tithing, we show gratitude to Him by returning a portion of what He has given us.
Paying tithing is an expression of faith.
It is also a way to honor God.
Jesus taught that we should “seek … first the kingdom of God” (
Matthew 6:33
), and tithing is a way of doing that.
Image
Widow’s Mite, by Sandra Rast
Use of Tithing Funds
Tithing funds are sacred.
We give our tithing to a member of the bishopric, or in many areas we can pay online.
When the bishopric receives tithing, they transmit it to Church headquarters.
A council composed of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Presiding Bishopric determines how to use tithing funds in God’s work (see
Doctrine and Covenants 120:1
).
These uses include:
Building and maintaining temples and meetinghouses.
Translating and publishing scriptures.
Supporting the activities and operations of local Church congregations.
Supporting missionary work throughout the world.
Supporting family history work.
Funding schools and education.
Tithing is not used to pay local Church leaders.
They serve voluntarily without any payment.
Blessings
When we pay tithing, God promises blessings that are far greater than what we give.
He will “open … the windows of heaven, and pour … out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it” (
Malachi 3:10
; see
verses 7–12
).
These blessings may be both spiritual and temporal.

Obey the Word of Wisdom
The Lord’s Law of Health
Our bodies are sacred gifts from God.
We each need a physical body to become more like Him.
Our bodies are so important that the scriptures compare them to temples (see
1 Corinthians 6:19–20
).
The Lord wants us to treat our bodies with respect.
To help us do this, He revealed a law of health called the Word of Wisdom.
This revelation teaches us about eating healthy foods and not using substances that harm our bodies—specifically alcohol, tobacco, and hot drinks (meaning tea and coffee).
In the spirit of the Word of Wisdom, modern prophets have warned against using other substances that are harmful, illegal, or addictive.
Prophets have also warned against abusing prescription drugs. (Your mission president will answer questions about whether other substances in your geographic area should not be used.)
Blessings
The Lord provided the Word of Wisdom for our physical and spiritual well-being.
He promises great blessings as we keep this commandment.
These blessings include health, wisdom, treasures of knowledge, and protection (see
Doctrine and Covenants 89:18–21
).
Obeying the Word of Wisdom will help us be more receptive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost.
Although we all experience health challenges, obeying this law will help us be healthier in body, mind, and spirit.
Baptismal candidates are to obey the Word of Wisdom.

Keep the Sabbath Day Holy
A Day for Rest and Worship
The Sabbath is a holy day that God has set apart for us each week to rest from our daily labors and worship Him.
One of the Ten Commandments given to Moses is to “remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (
Exodus 20:8
; see also
verses 9–11
).
In a modern revelation, the Lord reaffirmed that the Sabbath “is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High” (
Doctrine and Covenants 59:10
).
He also said the Sabbath should be a day of rejoicing, prayer, and thanksgiving (see
verses 14–15
).
As part of our Sabbath worship, we attend sacrament meeting each week.
In this meeting, we worship God and partake of the sacrament to remember Jesus Christ and His Atonement.
When we partake of the sacrament, we renew our covenants with God and show that we are willing to repent of our sins.
The ordinance of the sacrament is the center of our Sabbath-day observance.
At church we also participate in classes in which we learn more about the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Our faith grows as we study the scriptures together.
Our love grows as we serve and strengthen each other.
In addition to resting from our labors on the Sabbath, we should refrain from shopping and other activities that would make it feel like a common day.
We set aside the activities of the world and focus our thoughts and actions on spiritual matters.
A Day for Doing Good
Doing good on the Sabbath day is at least as important as what we refrain from doing to keep it holy.
We learn the gospel, strengthen faith, build relationships, give service, and participate in other uplifting activities with family and friends.
Image

Blessings
Keeping the Sabbath day holy is an expression of our devotion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
As we make our Sabbath activities compatible with God’s intent for the day, we will feel joy and peace.
We will be spiritually nourished and physically refreshed.
We will also feel closer to God and deepen our relationship with our Savior.
We will more fully keep ourselves “unspotted from the world” (
Doctrine and Covenants 59:9
).
The Sabbath will become “a delight” (
Isaiah 58:13
; see also
verse 14
).

Our Covenant to Serve God and Others
Service
When we are baptized, we covenant to serve God and to serve others.
Serving others is one of the primary ways we serve God (see
Mosiah 2:17
).
The prophet Alma taught those who desired to be baptized that they should be “willing to bear one another’s burdens, … mourn with those that mourn … , and comfort those that stand in need of comfort” (
Mosiah 18:8–9
).
Soon after baptism, new members typically receive a calling to serve in the Church.
These callings are voluntary and unpaid.
As we accept them and serve diligently, we grow in faith, develop talents, and bless others.
Another part of our service in the Church is being a “ministering brother” or a “ministering sister.” In this responsibility, we serve assigned individuals and families.
As disciples of Jesus Christ, we look for opportunities to serve each day.
Like Him, we go “about doing good” (
Acts 10:38
).
We serve our neighbors and others in our community.
We can participate in service opportunities through JustServe where it is available.
We can support the Church’s humanitarian efforts and participate in disaster response.

Sharing the Gospel
As part of our baptismal covenant, we promise to “stand as witnesses of God” (
Mosiah 18:9
).
One way we stand as witnesses is by sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Helping others receive the gospel is one of the most joyful kinds of service we can give (see
Doctrine and Covenants 18:15–16
).
It is a powerful expression of our love.
When we experience the blessings of living the gospel, we naturally want to share those blessings.
Family members, friends, and acquaintances often become interested as we set a faithful example and they see how the gospel blesses our lives.
We can share the gospel in normal and natural ways (see
General Handbook
,
chapter 23
).
We invite others to participate with us in service, community, recreational, and Church activities.
We can invite them to a Church meeting or a baptismal service.
We can invite them to watch an online video that explains the gospel of Jesus Christ, to read the Book of Mormon, or to visit a temple open house.
There are hundreds of invitations we can extend.
Often, inviting simply means including our family, friends, and neighbors in what we are already doing.
If we ask, God will help us recognize opportunities to share the gospel and tell others about how it blesses our lives.

Fasting and Fast Offerings
God established the law of the fast as a way for us to develop spiritual strength and to help those in need.
Fasting means going without food and drink for a period of time.
The Church usually sets aside the first Sunday of every month as a day of fasting.
A fast day typically includes going without food and drink for a 24-hour period if we are physically able.
Other important parts of fast Sunday include prayer and bearing testimony.
We are also encouraged to fast at other times when we feel the need.
Building Spiritual Strength
Fasting can help us become humble, draw closer to God, and feel spiritually renewed.
Before beginning His ministry, Jesus Christ fasted (see
Matthew 4:1–2
).
The scriptures record many accounts of prophets and others fasting so they might increase their spiritual strength and seek special blessings for themselves or others.
Fasting and prayer go together.
When we fast and pray with faith, we are more attuned to receiving personal revelation.
We are also more receptive to recognizing truth and understanding God’s will.
Helping Those in Need
When we fast, we donate money to the Church to help care for people in need.
This is called a fast offering.
We are invited to give an offering that is at least equal to the value of the meals not eaten.
We are encouraged to be generous and give more than the value of these meals if we can.
Giving a fast offering is one way we can serve others.
Fast offerings are used to provide food and other necessities to people in need, both locally and worldwide.
For information about how to contribute fast offerings, see “

Our Covenant to Endure to the End
When we are baptized, we covenant with God to “endure to the end” in living the gospel of Jesus Christ (
2 Nephi 31:20
; see also
Mosiah 18:13
).
We strive to be lifelong disciples of Jesus Christ.
The Book of Mormon prophet Nephi described baptism as the gate by which we enter the gospel path (see
2 Nephi 31:17
).
After baptism, we continue to “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ” (
2 Nephi 31:20
).
As we “press forward” on the path of discipleship, we prepare to go to the temple.
There we will make covenants with God as we receive temple ordinances.
In the temple, we will be endowed with power and can be sealed as families for eternity.
Keeping the covenants we make in the temple will open the door to every spiritual privilege and blessing that God has for us.
As we continue faithfully along the gospel path, we will eventually receive God’s greatest gift—the gift of eternal life (see
2 Nephi 31:20
;
Doctrine and Covenants 14:7
).
The following sections explain some aspects of what God has provided to help us endure to the end of our mortal journey—and find joy in it.
Priesthood and Church Organizations
The priesthood is the authority and power of God.
Through the priesthood, Heavenly Father accomplishes His work “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life” of His children (
Moses 1:39
).
God grants authority and power to His sons and daughters on earth to help carry out this work.
The priesthood blesses all of us.
Ordinances such as baptism and the sacrament are received through those who hold priesthood offices.
We also receive blessings of healing, comfort, and counsel.
The Priesthood and Church Leadership and Callings
The Church is led by Jesus Christ through prophets and apostles.
These leaders are called of God, ordained, and given priesthood authority to act in the Savior’s name.
Anciently, Christ gave His Apostles this same priesthood authority, which allowed them to lead His Church after He ascended to heaven.
Eventually that authority was lost when people rejected the gospel and the Apostles died.
Heavenly messengers restored the priesthood in 1829 through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the Lord again established His Church with apostles and prophets. (See
lesson 1
.)
At the local level, bishops and stake presidents have priesthood authority to lead Church congregations.
When men and women are called and set apart to serve in the Church, they are given authority from God to act in that calling.
This authority is given to missionaries, leaders, teachers, and others until they are released from their callings.
It is delegated under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys.
Priesthood authority can be used only in righteousness (see
Doctrine and Covenants 121:34–46
).
This authority is a sacred trust to represent the Savior and act in His name.
It is always intended to bless and serve others.

Aaronic Priesthood and Melchizedek Priesthood
In the Church, the priesthood includes the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood.
Under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys, the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood are conferred on worthy male Church members.
After the appropriate priesthood is conferred, the person is ordained to an office in that priesthood, such as deacon or elder.
He must be ordained by someone who has the necessary authority.
When a man or young man receives the priesthood, he makes a covenant with God to fulfill sacred duties, serve others, and help build up the Church.
Young men may receive the Aaronic Priesthood and be ordained deacons beginning in January of the year they turn 12.
They may be ordained teachers in the year they turn 14 and priests in the year they turn 16.
Male converts who are of age may receive the Aaronic Priesthood soon after baptism and confirmation.
Aaronic Priesthood holders administer ordinances such as the sacrament and baptism.
After serving for a time as a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood, a worthy man who is at least 18 may receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained an elder.
Men who receive the Melchizedek Priesthood can perform priesthood ordinances such as giving blessings of healing and comfort to family members and others.

Marriage and Families
Marriage
Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.
It is central to His plan for the eternal progress of His children.
The union of a husband and wife in marriage should be their most cherished earthly relationship.
They have a sacred responsibility to be loyal to each other and faithful to their marriage covenant.
A husband and wife are equal in God’s eyes.
One should not dominate the other.
Their decisions should be made in unity and love, with full participation of both.
As a husband and wife love each other and work together, their marriage can be the source of their greatest happiness.
They can help each other and their children progress toward eternal life.
The Family
Like marriage, the family is ordained of God and is central to His plan for our eternal happiness.
Our families are most likely to be happy when we live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Parents teach their children the gospel of Jesus Christ and set an example in living it.
Families provide opportunities for us to love and serve each other.
Parents should make their family their highest priority.
It is a sacred privilege and responsibility for parents to care for the children they are able to bear or adopt.
All families have challenges.
As we seek God’s support and keep His commandments, family challenges can help us learn and grow.
Sometimes these challenges help us learn to repent and forgive.
Image
father teaching family
Church leaders have encouraged members to hold a weekly home evening.
Parents use this time to teach their children the gospel, strengthen family relationships, and have fun together.
Church leaders have also issued a proclamation that teaches important truths about the family (see “
The Family: A Proclamation to the World
,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org).
Other ways to strengthen the family include family prayer, scripture study, and worshipping together at church.
We can also research family history, gather family stories, and serve others.
Many people have limited opportunities for marriage or for loving family relationships.
Many have experienced divorce and other difficult family circumstances.
However, the gospel blesses us individually regardless of our family circumstance.
And as we are faithful, God will provide a way for us to have the blessings of loving families, whether in this life or in the life to come.

Temple and Family History Work for Deceased Ancestors
Heavenly Father loves all His children and desires their salvation and exaltation.
Yet billions of people have died without hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ or receiving the saving ordinances of the gospel.
These ordinances include baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination for men, the temple endowment, and eternal marriage.
Through His grace and mercy, the Lord has provided another way for these people to receive the gospel and its ordinances.
In the spirit world, the gospel is preached to those who have died without receiving it (see
Doctrine and Covenants 138
).
In temples, we can perform the ordinances on behalf of our deceased ancestors and others.
These deceased people in the spirit world can then accept or reject the gospel and the ordinances performed for them.
Image
family studying scriptures
Before we can perform these ordinances, we need to identify our ancestors who have not received them.
Identifying our family members so they can receive ordinances is a central purpose of our family history work.
When we find information about them, we add it to the Church’s database at
FamilySearch.org
.
Then we (or others) can perform proxy ordinances for them in the temple.
As we identify our ancestors and perform ordinances for them, our families may become united for eternity.
Family History Work and Temple Attendance
Introduce new members and those you are teaching to the ward temple and family history leader (or to another member who is familiar with temple and family history work).
This leader can help people identify their deceased relatives who need temple ordinances.
Use the weekly coordination meeting to plan how to help new members begin doing family history and temple work.
New members and other members may receive from their bishop a temple recommend to perform proxy baptisms and confirmations for their deceased ancestors and others.
A member is eligible to receive this recommend beginning in January of the year he or she turns 12.
Males also need to hold the Aaronic Priesthood to be eligible.
Encourage new members to obtain a recommend as soon as is reasonable.
If a temple is nearby, go with new members if possible.
Participate with them in temple ordinances.

Temples, the Endowment, Eternal Marriage, and Eternal Families
Temples
The temple is the house of the Lord.
It is a holy place where we can make covenants with God as we receive His sacred ordinances.
As we keep these covenants, we will have the power of godliness manifest in our lives (see
Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–22
;
109:22–23
).
The Endowment
One of the ordinances we receive in the temple is called the endowment.
The word
endowment
means “a gift.” This gift of knowledge and power comes from God.
During the endowment, we make covenants with God that bind us to Him and His Son, Jesus Christ (see
chapter 1
).
Adults may be eligible to receive their own temple endowment after at least one year of Church membership.
For more information about the endowment, see
General Handbook
,
27.2
.
Eternal Marriage and Eternal Families
God’s plan of happiness enables family relationships to endure beyond the grave.
In the temple we can be married for time and eternity.
This makes it possible for families to be together forever.
After married couples have received their temple endowment, they may be sealed or married for eternity.
Their children may be sealed to them.
A husband and wife who have been sealed in the temple must keep the covenants they have made to receive the blessings of eternal marriage.
Image
couple walking on street
Sensitivity When Teaching about Eternal Families
Some people may have family circumstances that make it unappealing for them to be together forever.
Others may not have a spouse or children in this life.
Remind those you are teaching that God’s plan is a plan of happiness.
Help them see that living the gospel now can prepare them for an eternal family in the future, even if that comes after this life.
Regardless of a person’s family or marital situation, adults should prepare to receive their own temple endowment.
Receiving their endowment will be a great strength to them.
Also help them see that they have an opportunity to unite deceased ancestors through temple work.

Seek and Rely on the Spirit
Consider This
What can I do to have the power of the Holy Ghost in my life and missionary service?
What is the role of the Holy Ghost in conversion?
How can I help the people we teach feel the influence of the Holy Ghost?
How can I make my prayers more meaningful?
How can I learn to recognize the promptings of the Holy Ghost?
Seek the Guidance of the Holy Ghost
The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of the greatest gifts that God has given His children.
It is vital in your work as a missionary.
You need the guiding, revelatory power of the Holy Ghost as you help people be baptized, confirmed, and converted.
Having the guidance of the Holy Ghost in your life requires spiritual work.
This work includes fervent prayer and consistent scripture study.
It also includes keeping your covenants and God’s commandments (see
Mosiah 18:8–10, 13
).
It includes worthily partaking of the sacrament each week (see
Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79
).
You face different needs and circumstances every day.
Promptings from the Spirit will help you know what to do and say.
As you seek and act on these promptings, the Holy Ghost will magnify your abilities and service to far exceed what you can do on your own.
He will help you in every aspect of your missionary service and your personal life. (See
2 Nephi 32:2–5
;
Alma 17:3
;
Helaman 5:17–19
;
Doctrine and Covenants 43:15–16

Light and Truth, by Simon Dewey
The Light of Christ
The Light of Christ “is given to every man, that he may know good from evil” (
Moroni 7:16
; see
verses 14–19
; see also
John 1:9
).
The Light of Christ is enlightenment, knowledge, and influence that are given through Jesus Christ.
This influence is preliminary to receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.
It will guide those who are receptive to learn and live the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
The Holy Ghost
The Personage of the Holy Ghost
The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead.
He is a personage of spirit and does not have a body of flesh and bones (see
Doctrine and Covenants 130:22
).
He is the Comforter, who the Savior promised would teach His followers all things and bring to their remembrance what Jesus had taught (see
John 14:26
).
The Power of the Holy Ghost
The witness that comes to sincere seekers of truth before baptism comes through the power of the Holy Ghost.
All people can receive a testimony of Jesus Christ and His restored gospel through the power of the Holy Ghost. “By the power of the Holy Ghost [we] may know the truth of all things” (
Moroni 10:5
).
The Gift of the Holy Ghost
The gift of the Holy Ghost is the right to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as we are worthy.
We receive the gift of the Holy Ghost after we are baptized by water.
It is conferred through the ordinance of confirmation.
The Prophet Joseph Smith said: “There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized” (
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith
[2007],
97
).
It is by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost that we are sanctified—made more holy, more complete, more whole, more like God.
It is through the redemption of Christ and the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost that we can be spiritually born again as we keep the covenants we make with God (see
Mosiah 27:25–26
).
The Holy Spirit of Promise
The Holy Ghost is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise (see
Doctrine and Covenants 88:3
).
In this capacity, the Holy Ghost confirms that the priesthood ordinances we receive and the covenants we make are acceptable to God.
Those who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise will receive all that the Father has (see
Doctrine and Covenants 76:51–60
;
Ephesians 1:13–14
; Guide to the Scriptures, “
Holy Spirit of Promise
”).
All ordinances and covenants must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise to be valid after this life (see
Doctrine and Covenants 132:7, 18–19, 26
).
That sealing depends on our continued faithfulness.
Gifts of the Spirit
The Lord gives us gifts of the Spirit to bless us and to use in blessing others (see
Doctrine and Covenants 46:8–9, 26
).
For example, missionaries who learn a new language may receive the gift of tongues to give them divine help to teach others in their native language.
Several gifts of the Spirit are described in
Moroni 10:8–18
,
Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–33
, and
1 Corinthians 12:1–12
.
These are only some of the many gifts of the Spirit.
The Lord may bless us with other gifts depending on our faithfulness, our needs, and the needs of others.
The Savior invites us to earnestly seek spiritual gifts (see
Doctrine and Covenants 46:8
;
1 Corinthians 14:1, 12
).
These gifts come by prayer, faith, and effort—and according to God’s will.

The Power of the Spirit in Conversion
Conversion occurs through the power of the Holy Ghost.
Your role is to help bring the power of the Spirit into a person’s life.
Some ways you can do this are suggested below.
Seek to have the Spirit with you through prayer, searching the scriptures, and keeping your covenants.
Teach by the Spirit about the Savior and the message of the Restoration.
Follow the guidance of the Spirit in adapting your message to each person’s needs.
Testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true.
As you testify, the Holy Ghost can bear witness to others.
Invite people to act, and support them in keeping their commitments.
As people keep commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly.
See
chapter 11
.
Follow up by asking people about their experiences as they acted on an invitation.
Their faith will grow as they repent, obey the commandments, and keep their commitments.
Help them recognize the Spirit working with them.
Image
President M.
Russell Ballard
President M. Russell Ballard taught: “True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit.
When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed.
When individuals … feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases.
These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word [see
Alma 32:27
].
This is how we come to
feel
the gospel is true” (“
Now Is the Time

2000, 75).

Pray with Faith in Jesus Christ
To help others become converted, you need to teach by the power of the Spirit (see
Doctrine and Covenants 50:13–14, 17–22
).
The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (
Doctrine and Covenants 42:14
).
As you pray for help in your teaching, the power of the Holy Ghost will carry your teachings “unto the hearts of the children of men” (
2 Nephi 33:1
).
As you teach by the Spirit and others receive by the Spirit, you will “understand one another” and be “edified and rejoice together” (
Doctrine and Covenants 50:22
).
How to Pray
Jesus taught us how to pray (see
Matthew 6:9–13
;
3 Nephi 18:19
).
Pray sincerely and with real intent to act on the promptings you receive from the Holy Ghost.
Effective prayer requires humble, sustained effort (see
Moroni 10:3–4
;
Doctrine and Covenants 8:10
).
Use language that conveys a loving, worshipful relationship with God.
In English, use scriptural language such as
Thee
,
Thou
,
Thy
, and
Thine
rather than the more common pronouns
you
,
your
, and
yours
.
Always express gratitude.
A conscious effort to be grateful will help you recognize how merciful God has been in your life.
It will open your heart and mind to inspiration.
Pray “with all the energy of heart” for charity to be bestowed upon you (
Moroni 7:48
).
Pray for others by name.
Pray for those you are teaching.
Seek inspiration for how you will invite and help them to come unto Christ.
Personal Study
Study the Lord’s prayer in
Matthew 6:9–13
.
Ask yourself the following questions, and record impressions in your study journal.
How does your current responsibility as a missionary influence your prayers?
In what ways are your prayers seeking to bless the lives of others?
How are you praying to be able to overcome temptation?
How do you pray for help in fulfilling your spiritual and temporal needs?
How do you give glory to God when you pray?
When to Pray
When should you pray?
The Lord said, “Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good” (
Doctrine and Covenants 90:24
).
Alma said, “Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God” (
Alma 37:37
; see also
34:17–27
).
The Lord invites you to reserve quiet, private times to pray: “Enter into thy closet, and … pray to thy Father” (
3 Nephi 13:6
; see also
verses 7–13
).
President Gordon B.
Hinckley taught: “Every morning … , missionaries should get on their knees and plead with the Lord to loosen their tongues and speak through them to the blessing of those they will be teaching.
If they will do this, a new light will come into their lives.
There will be greater enthusiasm for the work.
They will come to know that in a very real sense, they are servants of the Lord speaking in His behalf” (“Missionary Service,”
First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting
, Jan. 11, 2003, 20).
Trusting God When We Pray
Having faith in God means trusting Him.
This includes trusting His will and His timing in answering your prayers (see
Isaiah 55:8–9
).
President Dallin H.
Oaks taught:
“No matter how strong our faith is, it cannot produce a result contrary to the will of Him in whom we have faith.
Remember that when your prayers do not seem to be answered in the way or at the time you desire.
The exercise of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is always subject to the order of heaven, to the goodness and will and wisdom and timing of the Lord.
When we have that kind of faith and trust in the Lord, we have true security and serenity in our lives” (“
The Atonement and Faith
,”
Ensign
, Apr.
2010, 30).
Concerning prayers that may seem to go unanswered, President Russell M.
Nelson said:
“I know that feeling!
I know the fears and tears of such moments.
But I also know that our prayers are never ignored.
Our faith is never unappreciated.
I know that an all-wise Heavenly Father’s perspective is much broader than is ours.
While we know of our mortal problems and pain, He knows of our immortal progress and potential.
If we pray to know His will and submit ourselves to it with patience and courage, heavenly healing can take place in His own way and time” (“
Jesus Christ—the Master Healer
,”
Ensign
or
Liahona
, Nov.
2005, 86).

Road to Emmaus, by Greg Olsen
Learn to Recognize the Promptings of the Spirit
It is important for you and the people you teach to learn to recognize communications from the Spirit.
The Spirit usually communicates quietly, through your feelings, mind, and heart.
The prophet Elijah found that the voice of the Lord was not in the wind, the earthquake, or the fire—but was “a still small voice” (
1 Kings 19:12
).
It is “not a voice of thunder,” but rather “a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper,” and yet it can “pierce even to the very soul” (
Helaman 5:30
).
Communications from the Spirit can feel different to different people.
Regardless of how these communications feel, the scriptures teach how to recognize them.
For example, the Spirit will edify you and lead you to do good.
He will enlighten your mind.
He will lead you to walk humbly and judge righteously. (See
Doctrine and Covenants 11:12–14
and the “Personal Study” box later in this section.)
In answer to the question “How do we recognize the promptings of the Spirit?” President Gordon B.
Hinckley read
Moroni 7:13, 16–17
.
He then said:
“That’s the test, when all is said and done.
Does it persuade one to do good, to rise, to stand tall, to do the right thing, to be kind, to be generous?
Then it is of the Spirit of God. …
“… If it invites to do good, it is of God.
If it inviteth to do evil, it is of the devil. … And if you are doing the right thing and if you are living the right way, you will know in your heart what the Spirit is saying to you.
“You recognize the promptings of the Spirit by the fruits of the Spirit—that which enlighteneth, that which buildeth up, that which is positive and affirmative and uplifting and leads us to better thoughts and better words and better deeds is of the Spirit of God” (
Teachings of Gordon B.
Hinckley
[1997], 260–61).
As you seek and follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost, your ability to discern and understand His promptings will develop over time (see
2 Nephi 28:30
).
In some ways, becoming more attuned to the language of the Spirit is like learning another language.
It is a gradual process that requires diligent, patient effort.
Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost with full purpose of heart.
If you are preoccupied with other things, you may not sense the gentle whisperings of the Spirit.
Or He may wait to communicate until you seek His influence with a humble willingness to act on His promptings.
The voices in the world compete for your attention.
They can easily crowd out spiritual impressions unless you give place for the Spirit in your heart.
Remember this counsel from the Lord: “Be still, and know that I am God” (
Psalm 46:10
; see also
Doctrine and Covenants 101:16
).
Image
Elder David A.
Bednar
“God uses a variety of patterns to convey revelations to His sons and daughters, such as thoughts to the mind and feelings to the heart, dreams, … and inspiration.
Some revelations are received immediately and intensely; some are recognized gradually and subtly.
Receiving, recognizing, and responding to revelations from God are spiritual gifts for which we all should yearn and appropriately seek” (David A.
Bednar, “The Spirit of Revelation in the Work,” 2018 mission leadership seminar).

Rely on the Spirit
As the Lord’s servant, you are to do His work in His way and by His power.
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “no man can preach the Gospel without the Holy Ghost” (
Teachings: Joseph Smith
,
332
).
Trust the Spirit to guide you in every aspect of your work.
He will enlighten and inspire you.
He will help you find people to teach and will bring power to your teaching.
He will assist as you help members, returning members, and new converts strengthen their faith.
Some missionaries feel confident in themselves.
Others lack such confidence.
Humbly put your confidence and faith in Jesus Christ, not in yourself.
Rely on the Spirit rather than your own talents and abilities.
The Holy Ghost will magnify your efforts far beyond what you can do on your own.

Some Words of Caution
Confirm Your Impressions with Reliable Sources
As you pray for inspiration, compare your spiritual impressions with the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets.
Impressions from the Spirit will align with these sources.
Seek Revelation within Your Assignment
Be certain that the feelings you receive are consistent with your assignment.
Unless you are called by proper authority, impressions from the Spirit are not given for you to counsel or correct others.
For example, you will not receive revelation to tell a bishop what he should do in his calling.

A Gift of Light
Discern the True Influence of the Spirit
President Howard W.
Hunter counseled: “Let me offer a word of caution. … I think if we are not careful … , we may begin to try to counterfeit the true influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and manipulative means.
I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit.
Certainly the Spirit of the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself” (
The Teachings of Howard W.
Hunter
[1997], 184).
Do Not Try to Force Spiritual Things
Spiritual matters cannot be forced.
You can cultivate an attitude and an environment that invite the Spirit, and you can prepare yourself, but you cannot dictate how or when inspiration comes.
Be patient and trust that you will receive what you need when the time is right.
Keep Spiritual Experiences Sacred
As a missionary, you may be more aware of spiritual experiences than you have been earlier in your life.
These experiences are sacred and are generally for your own edification, instruction, or correction.
Many of these experiences are best kept private.
Share only when the Spirit indicates that you can bless other people by doing so (see
Alma 12:9
;
Doctrine and Covenants 63:64
;
84:73
).
Use Your Own Best Judgment in Some Instances
Sometimes we want to be led by the Spirit in all things.
However, often the Lord wants us to act using our own best judgment (see
Doctrine and Covenants 60:5
;
61:22
;
62:5
).
President Dallin H.
Oaks taught:
“A desire to be led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for our personal choices.
Personal decision making is one of the sources of the growth we are meant to experience in mortality.
Persons who try to shift all decision making to the Lord and plead for revelation in every choice will soon find circumstances in which they pray for guidance and don’t receive it.
For example, this is likely to occur in those numerous circumstances in which the choices are trivial or either choice is acceptable.
“We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed within us.
Then we should pray for guidance and act upon it if we receive it.
If we do not receive guidance, we should act upon our best judgment.
Persons who persist in seeking revelatory guidance on subjects on which the Lord has not chosen to direct us may concoct an answer out of their own fantasy or bias, or they may even receive an answer through the medium of false revelation” (“
Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall
,”
Ensign
, Oct.
1994, 13–14).
Scripture Study
Relying on the Spirit is so important that the Lord warns us not to deny or quench the Spirit.
What do you learn from the following passages of scripture?
Jacob 6:8–9
3 Nephi 29:5–6
Mormon 9:7–9
Moroni 10:7–8
Doctrine and Covenants 11:25–26
1 Thessalonians 5:19–20
Remember This
Seek your own witness from the Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ and His restored gospel.
Do the spiritual work necessary to have the guidance of the Holy Ghost in your life.
The Holy Ghost will magnify your abilities and service to far exceed what you could do on your own.
Conversion occurs through the power of the Holy Ghost.
Help bring that power into a person’s life.
Study and pray to learn how to recognize the promptings of the Spirit.
Rely on the Spirit to help you know where to go and what to teach.
Ideas for Study and Application
Personal Study
Divide a page into two columns.
Label one column “What the Lord Did” and the other column “What Lehi or Nephi Did.” Read the story of the Liahona and the broken bow (
1 Nephi 16:9–31
) or the story of Nephi building a ship (
1 Nephi 17:7–16
;
18:1–6
).
List events from the story in the appropriate columns.
Consider what the story can teach you about the nature of inspiration.
Look through your journal and find occasions when you have been led by the Spirit or have experienced a gift of the Spirit.
Think about when, where, and why these experiences happened.
How was the Lord’s hand manifest?
How did you feel?
Remembering these experiences can help you recognize the Spirit.
Study
Alma 33:1–12
and
Alma 34:17–31
.
What questions were Alma and Amulek answering? (Review
Alma 33:1–2
.) How did they answer these questions?
What assurances did they give?
The Lord has promised that the Spirit will guide us in many important ways.
As you read the following passages, identify aspects of your work that require the guidance of the Spirit.
What do the principles in the following scriptures mean for your personal and companion study?
for district council meetings, zone conferences, baptismal services, and other meetings?

Companion Study and Companion Exchange
Talk about the prayers you offer as companions.
Are they guided by the Holy Ghost?
How have you received answers to your prayers as a companionship?
When you pray as companions, do you:
Believe that God will give you what you ask for in righteousness and according to His will?
Acknowledge and give thanks for answers to your prayers?
Pray for people by name and consider their needs?
Pray for each other and for the Spirit to guide you?
Recognize the answers to your prayers?
Pray with a commitment to act on the promptings you receive?
Discuss how you will seek the Spirit more earnestly.
Discuss the different ways that people describe the influence of the Holy Ghost.
Keep a record in your study journal of comments that those you teach have made about their experiences with the Spirit.
How can you help others recognize this sacred influence?
District Council, Zone Conferences, and Mission Leadership Council
As appropriate, have missionaries share a story or experience they heard in a recent testimony meeting, teaching experience, or other setting.
The spiritual stories and experiences other people tell can help you develop faith and recognize that the Spirit’s influence is widely and frequently manifest.
Ask the missionaries to give talks about the mission and power of the Holy Ghost.
Discuss how expressing gratitude helps you see the small but very significant ways the Lord blesses you (see
Ether 3:5
;
Doctrine and Covenants 59:21
).
Discuss ways to express gratitude.
Consider asking a new member to talk about how he or she was influenced by the Spirit when learning about the Church.
Ask the person to share only experiences that he or she feels are appropriate.
Mission Leaders and Mission Counselors
You might ask missionaries to include appropriate spiritual experiences in their weekly letter to you.
In interviews or in conversations, occasionally ask missionaries about their morning and evening prayers.
If needed, counsel with them about how to make their prayers more meaningful.
Ask missionaries how they help those they teach to feel and recognize the Spirit.

Jesus Teaching in the Western Hemisphere (Jesus Christ Visits the Americas), by John Scott
Chapter 5
Use the Power of the Book of Mormon
Consider This
How is the Book of Mormon the keystone of our religion?
Why is the Book of Mormon so powerful in the conversion process?
What does the Book of Mormon teach about Jesus Christ?
How can I use the Book of Mormon to help myself and others draw closer to God?
How does the Book of Mormon address the questions of the soul?
How can I help people read and gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon?
The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion.
This book is an ancient, sacred record written to convince all people that Jesus is the Christ (see the
title page of the Book of Mormon
).
As its subtitle says, the Book of Mormon is “another testament of Jesus Christ.” It is also compelling evidence that God called Joseph Smith as a prophet and restored the gospel of Jesus Christ through him.
Image

The Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (
introduction to the Book of Mormon
).
On another occasion he said: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion?
We have none” (
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith
[2007],
196
).
An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge-shaped pieces that lean against each other.
The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and holds them in place.
President Ezra Taft Benson said the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion in at least three ways:
Witness of Christ.
“The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do.
It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.”
Fulness of doctrine.
“The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ’ [
Doctrine and Covenants 20:9
;
27:5
]. … In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of [the doctrine] required for our salvation.
And [it is] taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.”
Foundation of testimony.
“Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. … If the Book of Mormon be true … one must accept the claims of the Restoration.” (
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson
[2014],
129
,
131
,
128
.)
By gaining a testimony that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, we can know that Joseph Smith was a prophet.
Through him, God’s priesthood authority was restored by heavenly messengers.
God also authorized Joseph to organize the Church of Jesus Christ.
Revelation continues today through living prophets.

The Book of Mormon Is Essential to Personal Conversion
An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true.
As you read and study it sincerely, you will feel its words enlarge your soul.
Its words will enlighten your understanding of life, of God’s plan, and of Jesus Christ (see
Alma 32:28
).
Pray about the book with real intent and faith in Christ.
As you do, you will receive a witness through the Holy Ghost that it is the word of God (see
Moroni 10:4–5
).
Your own testimony of the Book of Mormon can lead to a deep and abiding faith in its power to help others become converted.
Help the people you teach recognize the enlightenment they feel as they read it sincerely.
Emphasize its powerful witness of Jesus Christ.
Encourage them to pray to receive their own witness that the book is true.
Encouraging people to seek a witness from the Holy Ghost about the Book of Mormon should be a central focus of your teaching.
The Book of Mormon can change their lives forever.
Use the Book of Mormon to Teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ
The Prophet Joseph Smith said, “The Book of Mormon [is] the most correct of any book on earth” (
introduction to the Book of Mormon
).
It testifies of Christ and plainly teaches His doctrine (see
2 Nephi 31
;
32:1–6
;
3 Nephi 11:31–39
;
27:13–22
).
It teaches the fulness of His gospel.
The first principles and ordinances of the gospel as taught in the Book of Mormon are the way to an abundant life.
Use the Book of Mormon as your main source for teaching the restored gospel.
The following chart lists some of the truths in the Book of Mormon that you will teach.

The Book of Mormon Testifies of Christ
The central purpose of the Book of Mormon is to testify of Jesus Christ.
It affirms the reality of His life, mission, resurrection, and power.
It teaches true doctrine about Christ and His Atonement.
Several prophets whose writings are preserved in the Book of Mormon saw Christ personally.
The brother of Jared, Nephi, and Jacob saw the premortal Christ.
Multitudes were present during the Savior’s ministry among the Nephites (see
3 Nephi 11–28
).
Later, Mormon and Moroni saw the resurrected Christ (see
Mormon 1:15
;
Ether 12:39
).
As people read and pray about the Book of Mormon, they will come to know the Savior better and experience His love.
They will grow in their testimony of Him.
They will know how to come unto Him and be saved. (See
1 Nephi 15:14–15
.)

President Russell M.
Nelson
“The Book of Mormon provides the fullest and most authoritative understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be found anywhere.
It teaches what it really means to be born again. … We know why we are here on earth.
These and other truths are more powerfully and persuasively taught in the Book of Mormon than in any other book.
The full power of the gospel of Jesus Christ is contained in the Book of Mormon” (Russell M.

The Book of Mormon Helps Us Draw Nearer to God
Regarding the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man [or woman] would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (
introduction to the Book of Mormon
).
By consistently teaching and inviting people to live the principles in the Book of Mormon, you help them develop faith in Jesus Christ and draw nearer to God.
The Book of Mormon builds testimony and invites personal revelation.
Use the Book of Mormon to help people have spiritual experiences, especially a witness from the Holy Ghost that the book itself is the word of God.
Give priority to Book of Mormon passages when you teach.
They have converting power through the Holy Ghost.
When you teach the gospel using the Book of Mormon, your teaching will resonate with power and clarity in the heart and mind.
President Gordon B.
Hinckley taught that “those who have read [the Book of Mormon] prayerfully, be they rich or poor, learned or unlearned, have grown under its power.” He further taught:
“Without reservation I promise you that if you will prayerfully read the Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read it, there will come into your hearts an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord.
There will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“
The Power of the Book of Mormon
,”
Ensign
, June 1988, 6).

The Book of Mormon Addresses Questions of the Soul
Reading the Book of Mormon with the guidance of the Spirit can help people find answers or insights to their personal questions—or questions of the soul.
Help people see how the teachings in the Book of Mormon address life’s questions.
Some of these questions are listed below, along with Book of Mormon references that address them.
Does God exist?
Who is God? (

;
22:4–23
;
30:44
)
Does God know me and care about me?

;
Mosiah 4:9–12
;
Enos 1:1–12
;
Alma 18:32
;
Moroni 10:32–33
)
What is the purpose of life? (

Why is life so hard sometimes?
How can I find strength during hard times? (
1 Nephi 17:3
;
2 Nephi 4:20–21
;
Alma 36:3
;
Ether 12:27
)
How can I find peace in times of turmoil? (

;
Helaman 5:47
)
How can I be happier? (
Mosiah 2:41
;
Alma 22:15–16
)
How can I be a better person? (
Mosiah 26:30–31
;
Alma 5:12–13
;
7:23–24
;
Ether 12:27
)
How can I feel God’s forgiveness? (
Enos 1:2–8
;
Alma 36:17–21
)
What happens after I die? (
2 Nephi 9:3–6, 11–13
;
Alma 11:42–44
;
40:11
)
The Book of Mormon also provides guidance about other important questions, such as:
How can I contribute to the spiritual well-being of my family? (
1 Nephi 1:1
;
8:36–38
;
Mosiah 2:5–6
;
4:14–15

4:35
;
Mosiah 2:41

4 Nephi 1:15–18
)

President Dallin H.
Oaks
“Missionaries must know how to use the Book of Mormon to answer their own questions so they can use it effectively to help others learn to do the same. … They must internalize the power of the Book of Mormon in teaching the restored gospel, first by applying it in their own lives and then by sharing it with those they teach” (Dallin H.
Oaks, “Counsel for Mission Leaders,” seminar for new mission leaders, June 25, 2022).
Personal or Companion Study
List questions of the soul that you have or that you have heard from others.
Find verses in the Book of Mormon that help address these questions.
Write the insights and Book of Mormon references in your study journal.
Use them as you teach.
The Book of Mormon and the Bible Support Each Other
The Lord said to “teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel” (
Doctrine and Covenants 42:12
).
Latter-day Saints “believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly” (
Articles of Faith 1:8
; see also
1 Nephi 13:29
).
The Bible is sacred scripture.
The Book of Mormon is companion sacred scripture that contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
The Bible and Book of Mormon complement and enrich each other (see
Ezekiel 37:16–17
;
1 Nephi 13:40
;
Mormon 7:8–9
).
Both volumes of scripture are compilations of teachings recorded by ancient prophets.
The Bible tells of God’s interactions with people in the Eastern Hemisphere for thousands of years.
The Book of Mormon tells of God’s interactions with people in the ancient Americas for more than a thousand years.
Image
person highlighting scriptures
Most important, the Bible and Book of Mormon complement each other in witnessing of Jesus Christ.
The Bible provides the account of the Savior’s birth, mortal ministry, and Atonement—including His death and Resurrection.
The Book of Mormon includes prophecies of the Savior’s birth and mission, teachings about His Atonement, and the account of His ministry in the Americas.
The Book of Mormon confirms and expands the testimony of the Bible that Jesus is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior of the world.
Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon teach the law of witnesses: “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established” (
2 Corinthians 13:1
; see also
2 Nephi 11:2–3
).
Consistent with this law, both books of scripture testify of Jesus Christ (see
2 Nephi 29:8
).

You can help them understand the book by reading it with them.
Read during a teaching appointment, during a follow-up visit, or via technology.
You can also arrange for members to read with them.
Watching a Book of Mormon video and then reading the related chapters can be very helpful.
Pray for help as you select passages that address people’s concerns and needs.
Read and discuss short passages, such as
1 Nephi 3:7
or
Mosiah 2:17

Explain the background and context of the passage, such as who is speaking, what the person is like, and what the situation is.
If there is a relevant Book of Mormon video, consider showing it.
Point out key messages or doctrine to look for.
Share your testimony and appropriate insights, feelings, and personal experiences.
Teach doctrine directly from the words of Book of Mormon prophets.
This will help people feel the spiritual power of the book.
Help people “liken” what they read to their own lives (
1 Nephi 19:23
).
Help them see how the scriptures are relevant to them personally.
As you apply these principles, you will help people develop the ability and desire to read the Book of Mormon on their own.
Emphasize that reading the book daily is a key to progressing toward baptism and lifelong conversion.
Rely on the promise in
Moroni 10:3–5
.
Encourage people to read the Book of Mormon sincerely and to pray with real intent to know that it is true.
Explain that real intent means being willing to act on the answer they receive through the Holy Ghost.
Every person who sincerely reads and prays with real intent about the Book of Mormon can know of its truthfulness by the power of the Holy Ghost.
You should also apply this promise regularly to strengthen your own testimony of the Book of Mormon.
Your testimony will give you confidence that those who apply this promise will receive a witness that the book is the word of God.
Use the Book of Mormon in Every Aspect of Your Work
The Book of Mormon is a powerful resource in conversion.
Use it as your main source for teaching restored truth.
President Russell M.
Nelson said:
“Something powerful happens when a child of God seeks to know more about Him and His Beloved Son.
Nowhere are those truths taught more clearly and powerfully than in the Book of Mormon. …
“When I think of the Book of Mormon, I think of the word
power
.
The truths of the Book of Mormon have the
power
to heal, comfort, restore, succor, strengthen, console, and cheer our souls” (“The Book of Mormon: What Would Your Life Be Like without It?”
61, 62
).
When reading the Book of Mormon with people, share your testimony of the spiritual power you have felt as you have read it.
Emphasize the importance of its witness of Jesus Christ and His Atonement.
Share passages that can help people feel their Savior’s love.
Help them see how they can come to know the Savior better through its pages.
Read passages that will lift and strengthen people.
Focus on their needs.
Share examples of how the teachings in the Book of Mormon apply to our lives today.
Remember This
The Book of Mormon is the keystone of our witness of Christ, our doctrine, and our testimonies.
The Book of Mormon teaches plainly the doctrine found in the missionary lessons.
The Book of Mormon addresses questions of the soul.
Read consistently from the Book of Mormon with the people you teach.
Help them read on their own every day and apply what they learn.
Trust the Lord’s promise that everyone who sincerely reads and prays about the Book of Mormon will know of its truthfulness by the power of the Holy Ghost.

“There was much more to my reading than just marking scriptures.
With each reading of the Book of Mormon, front to back, I was filled with a profound love for the Lord.
I felt a deeply rooted witness of the truth of His teachings and how they apply to ‘this day.’ This book fits its title, ‘Another Testament of Jesus Christ.’ With that study and the spiritual witness that was received, I became a Book of Mormon missionary and a disciple of Jesus Christ” (“
This Day

Learn Your Mission Language
Consider This
How can I strengthen my faith in the Lord to help me learn a new language?
Why should I continually improve my language abilities?
How can I improve my ability to speak and teach in my mission language?
How can I obtain the gift of tongues?
Prepare Yourself Spiritually
The Lord declared, “Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power” (
Doctrine and Covenants 90:11
).
Listed below are ways you can strengthen your faith that the Lord will help you teach and testify in your mission language:
Believe that you have been called of God by a prophet.
Ask for God’s help through sincere prayer.
Work diligently by studying, practicing, and using your mission language each day.
Be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost by keeping the commandments and living the missionary standards.
Purify your motives by loving God and by loving His children and desiring to bless them.
Be Dedicated and Diligent
Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort and the gifts of the Spirit.
Do not be surprised if the task seems hard.
It takes time.
Be patient with yourself.
As you dedicate yourself to learning the language, you will acquire the skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a missionary.
You are not alone in learning your mission language.
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will help you as you seek Their help.
Seek and be open to the help of your companion, members, those you teach, other missionaries, and other people.
Listen carefully and speak the language at every opportunity.
Do not be afraid to make mistakes.
Everyone who learns a new language makes mistakes.
People will understand, and they will appreciate your efforts to learn their language.
Keep improving your language skills until the end of your mission.
As your ability to speak the language grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you say it.
You will be less worried about how to communicate and better able to respond to the needs of others.
Image
Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland
“We would … hope that every missionary learning a new … language would master it in every way possible. … And as you do so, your [teaching] and testifying skills will improve.
You will be better received by and more spiritually impressive to [the people you teach]. …
“Don’t be satisfied with what we call a missionary vocabulary only.
Stretch yourself in the language, and you will gain greater access to the hearts of the people” (Jeffrey R.
Holland, missionary satellite broadcast, Aug. 1998).
Continue to use your mission language after you return home.
The Lord has invested much in you, and He may have uses for your language abilities later in your life.
Learn English
If you do not speak English, you should study it as a missionary.
This will bless you during your mission and throughout your life.
Learning English will also bless your family.

Principles of Language Learning
Take Responsibility
Set goals for improving your language ability, and adjust them regularly.
Create a language study plan.
Use the language at every opportunity.
Make Your Study Meaningful
Apply what you study to real-life situations and in your daily activities.
Focus on language that will help you say what you need to say.
Seek to Communicate
Speak the language with your companion as much as possible.
Take advantage of every opportunity to learn and practice.
For example, you might ask a returning member or someone you are teaching to help you with the language.
There is no substitute for talking with native speakers of the language.
Do Not Compare
Do not compare your language skills with those of your companion or other missionaries.
Comparison leads to either pride or discouragement.
Learn New Concepts Thoroughly
Review regularly what you have studied, and practice it in new situations.
This will help you recall and apply what you are learning.
Image
man looking at book
Create a Language Study Plan
A language study plan helps both new and experienced missionaries focus on what they can do each day to improve their ability to speak their mission language.
Your plan will include what you will do during your language study time and throughout the day.
The following steps show how you can create a language study plan by using the goal-setting process from chapter 8.
Adapt this process as needed.
Prayerfully set goals and make plans.
Set weekly and daily goals to improve your general ability to communicate and teach the gospel.
Include things that you want to commit to memory, such as words, phrases, scriptures, and passages.
Record and schedule.
Decide which language tools will help you achieve your goals.
Language tools could include the scriptures, dictionaries, grammar books, the TALL Embark app, and others.
Schedule times when you will formally study and use the language.
For example, you might schedule to read aloud from the Book of Mormon for 15 minutes each day during lunch.
Act on your plans.
The Lord loves effort, so work diligently to accomplish your goals.
Protect your language study time and reschedule it for later if conflicts arise.
Review and follow up.
Review your study plan often to evaluate how well it is working.
Invite your companion, mission leaders, members, and others in your area to suggest ways you can improve.
Participate in regularly scheduled language assessments to chart your progress and identify ways to improve.
Balance your language study between long-term goals for creating a language foundation and short-term goals for specific activities and people you are teaching.
During your formal language study time, balance your goals and plans across the basic areas of language shown below.
Decide what you will learn throughout the day.
listening skills
reading skills
grammar
speaking skills
writing skills
vocabulary
Personal or Companion Study
Take time each week to evaluate your language study by asking the following questions:
Did I study my mission language each day this week?
What can I do to consistently improve my mission language?
Is my plan helping me find, teach, and work with members better?
What adjustments do I need to make to my plan?
What do I enjoy most about my language study?
What can I do to enjoy it more?
How much time should I be spending to practice listening, reading, writing, and speaking?
How can I better learn vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation?
What activities and resources am I using to study the language?
Which ones are helping me most?
What other resources or activities might be helpful?
What needs more attention?
After answering these questions, adjust your study plans and see if they improve your results.
The Spirit will guide you as you continually seek to improve your language study.
Learn with Your Companions
Help your companions experience success and gain confidence in learning the mission language or in learning English.
Sincerely and frequently compliment your companions and other missionaries on their progress.
Provide simple and practical feedback with kindness.
Give them many opportunities to teach and testify successfully.
Note how a more experienced missionary helped his companion in the following true account.
I had just arrived in my second area when my companion told me it was my turn to give the spiritual thought at a dinner appointment.
My first companion had always been happy to do the teaching, and I was used to giving my small portion of the lesson and then listening.
I tried to convince my companion that he should give the spiritual thought, but he encouraged me to take the assignment.
I practiced with his help.
When the moment arrived, I opened my scriptures and read from
3 Nephi 5
and
7
.
I struggled but managed to explain why I felt my chosen passages were significant, and I was relieved when I was done.
When a question was asked, I looked to my companion to answer, but he didn’t open his mouth.
That was when I amazed myself by coming up with an answer in understandable French.
I was even more amazed that the member didn’t seem to sense that I was insecure about my communication skills.
I gained confidence and realized that my French was better than I gave myself credit for.
The weeks passed, and my companion continued to let me teach—even when I didn’t think I could do it and even though he probably wondered if I could do it.
I felt that I had become a tool of our Father in Heaven instead of simply being a quiet companion.
Personal or Companion Study
Work with other missionaries to help you learn your mission language.
If you are working with a new missionary, how can you better help your companion learn the language or learn English?
If you are a new missionary, what kind of help might you ask from your companion?

Culture and Language Learning
Culture and language are closely related.
Understanding the culture of the people will help explain the way language is used.
This understanding will also help you communicate the unique aspects of the message of the Restoration in a way that will be clear to people.
One of the greatest things you can do to gain people’s trust and love is to respect and embrace their culture in appropriate ways.
Many great missionaries have done this (see
1 Corinthians 9:20–23
).
Personal or Companion Study
Use the idea below to help you prepare to teach someone who has a different culture or background.
Think about the cultural and religious background of the people you teach.
Identify an aspect of their background that might make it hard for them to understand a principle of the gospel.
Plan ways to teach this principle clearly.
The Gift of Tongues
Gifts of the Spirit are real.
The gift of tongues and the interpretation of tongues have many manifestations.
Some of these include speaking, understanding, and interpreting languages.
Today the gift of tongues is most often manifested in Spirit-enhanced learning and studying to help missionaries learn the language in their mission.
The Holy Ghost can manifest the truth of your testimony even though a language barrier may exist between you and those you teach.
Likewise, the Holy Ghost can bring words and phrases to your remembrance and help you understand what people are saying from their hearts.
For the most part, you will not obtain these gifts without effort.
You need to actively seek them to bless others (see
Doctrine and Covenants 46:8–9, 26
).
Part of seeking the gift of tongues is to labor and do all you can to learn the language.
Be patient as you prayerfully study and practice the language.
Trust that the Spirit will help you as you make a diligent effort.
Have faith that you can have the gift of tongues help you and those you teach.
When you struggle to express yourself as clearly as you would like, remember that the Spirit is able to speak to the hearts of God’s children.
President Thomas S.
Monson taught:
“There is one language … that is common to each missionary—the language of the Spirit.
It is not learned from textbooks written by men of letters, nor is it acquired through reading and memorization.
The language of the Spirit comes to him who seeks with all his heart to know God and keep His divine commandments.
Proficiency in this language permits one to breach barriers, overcome obstacles, and touch the human heart” (“
The Spirit Giveth Life
,”
Ensign
, June 1997, 2).
Personal or Companion Study
Use the following statements to evaluate your efforts to seek the gift of tongues.
Record impressions and goals to help you improve your language learning.
I believe that I have been called of God, through His prophet, to preach the gospel in a new language. (
Doctrine and Covenants 90:11
)
My love for the Lord and those I serve motivates me. (
Doctrine and Covenants 46:9
;
1 Corinthians 14:12
)
I strive to live worthy of the Holy Ghost by keeping the commandments, living mission standards, and repenting daily. (
Doctrine and Covenants 46:9, 33
)
I pray continually to obtain the gift of tongues. (
Doctrine and Covenants 46:28, 30–32
)
I study, practice, and use the mission language as much as possible each day. (
1 Corinthians 12:31
)
Remember This
Seek to strengthen your faith that Jesus Christ will help you learn your mission language.
Create a language study plan and regularly try new ideas to improve your language ability.
Seek the guidance of the Spirit to help you understand and communicate with the people of your mission.
Read aloud and study the Book of Mormon each day in your mission language.
Ideas for Study and Application
Personal Study
Review the language resources on Missionary Portal.
Identify something you haven’t tried, and set a goal to try it for the next few days.
At your next district council, ask an experienced missionary with good language ability what he or she has done to learn the language.
Companion Study and Companion Exchange
Practice teaching each other the missionary lessons in your mission language.
At first, new missionaries might teach very simply, share simple testimony, and recite memorized scriptures.
As their confidence and ability increase, they will be able to participate more fully in teaching.
Review the ideas in this chapter and the language resources on Missionary Portal.
Discuss which suggestions you could use in companion study during the next week.
Ask your companion to listen to your pronunciation and help you improve.
Ask him or her to take note of situations when you are not understood.
Make a list of words, phrases, or grammar that would help.
Explain and practice how to use what is on the list in upcoming activities.
Practice actively listening.
Plan a time during the day to listen actively to identify vocabulary and patterns you have learned.
When you hear a phrase expressed differently from the way you would say it, write it down and practice it.
Make a list of things people might say that day.
Plan and practice ways you could respond.
District Council, Zone Conferences, and Mission Leadership Council
Invite native speakers to attend one of these meetings.
Arrange for the missionaries to teach them in small groups.
Ask the native speakers to take notes and give feedback on the missionaries’ language ability.
Assign one or two missionaries ahead of time to tell about successes they have had in studying the language.
Assign an experienced missionary to briefly present some part of the language that is usually difficult for missionaries.
Have him or her present examples of good language use, and have the missionaries practice them.
Have missionaries who are native to the culture share their insights.
Mission Leaders and Mission Counselors
Emphasize the importance of consistently studying the language each day.
Encourage missionaries to use the mission language as much as possible.
Provide elements of a mission language study plan in a systematic study schedule.
Review this in district council meetings.
Look for opportunities to talk with missionaries in the language they are learning.
Periodically interview them in this language.
Ask local leaders and members for ideas on how missionaries can improve their language ability.
Give instruction in zone conference or mission leadership council on the most common mistakes made by missionaries who are learning your mission language.
Teach missionaries about spiritual gifts.
Observe missionaries when they teach in the mission language.

Accomplish the Work through Goals and Plans
Consider This
Why do I need to set goals?
How can the key indicators for conversion help me focus on the spiritual progress of individuals?
How do I set goals, make plans to accomplish them, and carry out my plans?
How do I conduct weekly and daily planning sessions?
How can I use the Preach My Gospel app to help me accomplish the work?
What is the principle of accountability?
How will it bless my efforts?
You are assigned to help with the Lord’s work in a specific area.
He wants you to bless individuals with His love and truth.
He wants you to invite and help them to come unto Him.
The Lord desires that you “be anxiously engaged in [this] good cause.” He asks that you “do many things of [your] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness” (
Doctrine and Covenants 58:27
; see
verses 26–29
).
Do all you can to leave each ward or branch where you serve stronger than when you arrived.
This chapter will help you learn how to set goals, make plans to accomplish them, and diligently carry out your plans.
It describes the key indicators for conversion, which guide your efforts to help God’s children progress spiritually.
It then presents a simple goal-setting process you can use in all aspects of missionary work, including your personal and companionship goals.
It also outlines how to conduct weekly and daily planning sessions with your companion.
Learning to set goals and make plans can bless you throughout your life.
It can help you make and keep covenants with God, serve faithfully in the Church, pursue education, grow in your employment, and build a strong family.
Scripture Study
What can you learn from the following scriptures about planning to help accomplish God’s work?
Moses 1:39
Doctrine and Covenants 88:119
Abraham 4–5
Luke 14:28–32

Help Others Become Converted to the Savior
Focus on Your Missionary Purpose
Perhaps you have wondered which of your many missionary duties are the most important.
This is a good question to consider as you set goals and plan each week and each day.
To help answer it, think about your purpose as a missionary:
“Invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.”
Let your missionary purpose guide your goals and plans.
Focus on how you can help individuals exercise their agency to become converted to the Savior and receive His gospel.
Seek the guidance of the Spirit and counsel with your companion as you set goals and make plans.
Then follow through with your plans and use your time effectively.
Image
President Dallin H.
Oaks
“We do not preach and teach in order to ‘bring people into the Church’ or to increase the membership of the Church.
We do not preach and teach just to persuade people to live better lives. … We invite all to come unto Christ by repentance and baptism and confirmation in order to open the doors of the celestial kingdom to the sons and daughters of God.
No one else can do this” (Dallin H.
Oaks, “The Purpose of Missionary Work,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1995).
Scripture Study
How did these missionaries and prophets accomplish their plans with the Lord’s help?
Alma 17:1–3
Ether 2:23–25
;
3:1–6
Align with the Key Indicators for Conversion
Church leaders have identified six key indicators for conversion.
Key indicators help you focus on the spiritual progress of God’s children.
They are intended to help you align your daily efforts with your missionary purpose.
The key indicators for conversion are shown below.
Image

New People Being Taught.
Each person (not baptized) who has received a lesson in a given week (but wasn’t taught in the past three months) and accepted a specific return appointment.
A lesson typically includes praying (when appropriate), teaching at least one gospel principle, and extending an invitation.
Image

People Who Are Baptized and Confirmed.
Each new member who has received the ordinances of baptism and confirmation and for whom the form was submitted electronically in a given week. (See
chapter 12
for the definition of a convert baptism and for information on creating records.)
Image
women at church
New Members Attending Sacrament Meeting.
Each new member whose Baptism and Confirmation Form was submitted within the past 12 months who attended sacrament meeting in a given week.
In summary, give priority to helping people choose to participate in these experiences.
Center your efforts on the following activities:
Those that help you find new people to teach
Those that help people progress toward making and keeping covenants
Those that help people who have been baptized and confirmed in the past year
If you cannot see how your efforts might help a person progress in a way that is reflected in your key indicators, evaluate whether the activity is a good use of your time.
For people you spend less time with, continue to nurture their interest in the gospel.
You could invite members to reach out to them.
You could also use technology to encourage them and continue to minister to them.
See “
Use Technology
” in chapter 9 for additional ideas.
Image
Elder Quentin L.
Cook
“The ultimate objective of planning and setting goals is to make disciples—that is, to have consecrated converts who make and keep sacred covenants, beginning with a baptismal covenant leading to temple covenants” (Quentin L.
Cook, “Purpose and Planning,” mission leadership seminar, June 25, 2019).
Set Key Indicator Goals and Make Plans
During weekly planning, you and your companion set goals for all the key indicators.
Your key indicator goals should reflect your desire to help more people experience the blessings of conversion.
Set goals and make plans to do things in your control that can influence key indicator outcomes.
For example:
You might set a key indicator goal to begin teaching a specific number of new people during the week.
Whether you reach that goal depends on other people’s agency.
But do what is in your control to accomplish it.
One way is to set a goal to talk with a certain number of new people each day.
Then plan how you will do that.
See the ideas in
Appendix 2
of this chapter and in
chapter 9
.
You might set key indicator goals to have a specific number of new members and people you are teaching attend sacrament meeting.
Whether they come or not depends on their agency.
But do what is in your control to influence these key indicator outcomes.
Plan when to invite them and how to follow up.
You might set a key indicator goal to have members participate in a specific number of lessons during the week.
Whether you reach that goal depends on the members and the people you are teaching.
But do what you can to influence this key indicator outcome.
Set a goal to work with ward leaders to have members present.
Then plan how you will coordinate their participation.
As a companionship, you set the key indicator goals for your own area.
Base them on (1) the progress of those you are teaching and (2) the need to find new people to teach.
Finding new people to teach is a constant need.
Mission-wide key indicator goals are based on the goals set by each companionship.
The Preach My Gospel app will help you stay focused on people as you set key indicator goals.
This app will also help you learn from past goals and show your progress toward current goals.
Key indicator goals and results are automatically reported to your mission leaders and young missionary leaders through the Preach My Gospel app.
Be careful not to emphasize one key indicator goal over the others.
An ongoing focus on all key indicators will help you consistently invite others to come unto Christ and make covenants.
Image
President Thomas S.
Monson
“When performance is measured, performance improves.
When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates” (quoted by Thomas S.
Monson, “Thou Art a Teacher Come from God,”
Improvement Era
, Dec.
1970, 101).
Work Diligently
The Lord desires that you “act … in all diligence” in your missionary service (
Doctrine and Covenants 107:99
).
Diligence is a consistent, valiant effort.
Work diligently on your key indicator goals.
Invite people to make commitments that lead to conversion.
Your diligent efforts can inspire them to take actions that will help them come unto Christ (see
2 Nephi 2:14–16
).
Teach the gospel in ways that meet people’s needs.
The doctrine, when understood by the Spirit, is more likely than anything else to inspire them to act.
At the same time, recognize that key indicator goals depend on the agency of others.
Always respect people’s agency.
Remember that key indicators are not the end goal.
Instead, they represent a person’s potential spiritual progress toward baptism, confirmation, and enduring conversion.
People’s actual progress will depend on their choices.
You support their progress by exercising faith in Christ on their behalf as you set goals, plan, act diligently, and minister to them in an inspired way.
How to Set Goals and Make Plans to Accomplish Them
Goal setting and planning are acts of faith.
Goals reflect the desires of your heart and your vision of helping yourself and others come to the Savior.
Carefully considered goals and plans will give you clear direction.
They can help you find more people to teach.
They can guide you in helping those you teach strengthen their faith and progress toward conversion.
Make your goal setting and planning an inspired experience.
Pray earnestly, exercise faith, counsel with your companion, and follow the promptings of the Spirit.
As you plan this way, you will feel the Lord working through you to bless others.
Image
President M.
Russell Ballard
“A goal is a destination or an
end
, while a plan is the route by which you get there. … Goal setting is essentially beginning with the end in mind.
And planning is devising a way to get to that end” (M. Russell Ballard, “
Return and Receive
,”
Ensign
or
Liahona
, May 2017, 62–63).

As you use this goal-setting process, the Lord will magnify your efforts.
You will grow in your capacity as an instrument in His hands.
You will bring about much good in blessing Heavenly Father’s children.
Set Goals and Make Plans in All Areas of the Work
Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Spirit as you apply the goal-setting process to all aspects of missionary work.
Some of these include:
Helping people you are teaching to make progress (see
Appendix 1
in this chapter).
Finding new people to teach (see
Appendix 2
in this chapter).
Working with members and serving people in the community and ward (see
chapters 9
and
13
).
Working in unity with your companion (see
item 6
in “Weekly Planning Session”).
Strengthening your faith in Jesus Christ.
Improving your knowledge and abilities, including language learning (see
chapter 7
).
Set Appropriate Goals
Avoid setting key indicator goals for other missionaries.
However, you may guide and encourage them in applying the principles of goal setting as they set their own goals.
Be careful not to make comparisons with others.
Do not use goal achievement as a quota, for public recognition, or to publicly correct or embarrass anyone.

President Spencer W.
Kimball
“We do believe in setting goals.
We live by goals. … [One] important goal is to bring the gospel to all people. … Our goal is to achieve eternal life.
That is the greatest goal in the world” (Spencer W.
Kimball, regional representatives’ seminar, Apr. 3, 1975, 6).
Conduct Weekly and Daily Planning Sessions
Weekly planning helps you see the big picture and focus on people.
It also helps you focus on activities that are most important.
Daily planning helps you adapt and prepare to take specific actions each day.
You want to be productive, not just busy.
During planning sessions, ask yourself basic questions about what you feel the Lord would have you do.
Seek inspiration to answer these questions in ways that are appropriate for each situation and person.
The answers should then take shape in your plans.
Weekly Planning Session
Hold a weekly planning session with your companion on a day and time set by your mission president.
Follow the steps below.
Pray and seek inspiration.
Ask Heavenly Father to guide you in making plans that will help accomplish His purposes.
Ask Him to bless your efforts to help people progress and come unto Christ.
Set goals and make plans for all the key indicators using the Preach My Gospel app.
Use the goal-setting process described earlier in this chapter.
Begin with:
People who were baptized and confirmed within the past year.
People who have a baptismal date.
People you are teaching who attend sacrament meeting.
New people being taught.
Returning members, part-member families, and prospective elders.
People previously taught.
See
Appendix 1
in this chapter for ideas about using the goal-setting process in working with people you are teaching.
Use the goal-setting process to find people to teach
(see
Appendix 2
in this chapter and
chapter 9
for help with finding).
Use the goal-setting process to build relationships with ward leaders and members.
Set goals and make plans for how you will support them in their efforts to share the gospel (see ideas in
chapters 9
and
13
).
Prepare for the ward’s weekly coordination meeting (see
chapter 13
).
Review your plans and goals in the Preach My Gospel app.
Confirm your appointments and meetings.
Hold a companionship council.
This usually includes the following elements:
If desired, share appropriate personal goals and ask your companion for help in accomplishing them.
Discuss the strength of your relationship.
Discuss any challenges with being obedient or working in unity.
Resolve any conflicts by (1) allowing each person to fully express his or her views, (2) understanding and accepting each person’s concerns, and (3) building a solution together that addresses the most important concerns.
Share with your companion what you think his or her strengths are.
Ask for suggestions on how you can improve.
Set goals that will improve your relationship.
Companionship councils can help you develop important skills that you can use in your personal and family life, Church service, employment, and other associations.
Conclude with prayer.
Daily Planning Session
Set goals and make plans with your companion for 30 minutes every morning.
Follow the steps below.
Pray and seek inspiration.
Review progress toward your weekly key indicator goals.
Review your plans to help people you are teaching.
Prioritize your efforts to help those who are making the most progress.
Adjust daily goals and plans as needed.
Commit to actions you will take that day to find new people to teach and to help people you are teaching.
Plan how you will work with local leaders and members.
Conclude with prayer.
Companion Study
Review
Appendix 1
and
Appendix 2
at the end of this chapter for ideas about how to apply the goal-setting process in teaching and finding.
Identify how you can use some of these ideas.
Use the Preach My Gospel App
Concerning those who were baptized in his day, Moroni said, “Their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way” (
Moroni 6:4
).
Keeping good records is one way you can apply this principle.
Record Your Efforts
Keeping records is part of diligently watching over your area with love and concern.
Keep your records accurate and up to date.
This will help you remember what you need to do to help people.
The Preach My Gospel app allows you to coordinate and share important information with local leaders and members on the progress of people and the work.
Follow Data and Privacy Guidelines
Follow data retention and privacy guidelines when recording goals and plans in the Preach My Gospel app and in printed tools.
For information, see
Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ
,
7.5
.
Ask yourself the following questions before you record or share information in the Preach My Gospel app, email, social media, notes, or other communications:
How would this person feel about what I am recording?
How would I feel if someone shared this kind of information about me with others?
Am I following Church policies and data privacy laws for my area if I record or share this information?

Accountability
The principle of accountability is fundamental in God’s eternal plan (see
Alma 5:15–19
;
Doctrine and Covenants 104:13
;
137:9
).
This principle influences how you think and feel about the sacred responsibility the Lord has given you.
Accountability also influences how you approach your work.
During His earthly ministry, the Savior gave assignments to His disciples to help them grow, develop, and accomplish His work.
He also gave them opportunities to account for the work they were given to do (see
Luke 9:10
;
3 Nephi 23:6–13
).
As a missionary, you likewise account for the work the Lord has given you to do.
Approach your goal setting and planning with the idea that you will account to the Lord through prayer each day.
Also be accountable to yourself and to your mission leaders.
Rendering an account should be a loving, positive experience in which your efforts are recognized and you identify ways you can improve.

Remember This
Focus your efforts on your missionary purpose.
For each key indicator, set goals that help you stretch, exercise faith, and work effectively.
Use the goal-setting process to set goals and make plans in all areas of your work.
Conduct weekly and daily planning sessions as outlined in this chapter.
Use the Preach My Gospel app to record and share your efforts.
Account for your efforts to the Lord and to mission leaders.
Ideas for Study and Application
Personal Study
Consider the following sentence from your call letter: “As you devote your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs, the Lord will bless you with increased knowledge and testimony of Jesus Christ and His restored gospel.” Ask yourself the following questions, and record your impressions.
How am I doing with devoting my time and attention to serving the Lord?
What blessings have I experienced?
How has my testimony been strengthened?
How can I improve?
Take a few moments to think about your last day in the mission field.
When that day comes:
What do you want your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to be like?
What do you want to have become?
In your study journal, write an answer to each of these questions.
Use the goal-setting process to plan what you can do now to work toward these goals.
Record your plans.
Companion Study and Companion Exchange
Using the Preach My Gospel app, answer the questions below:
Are all the records current and accurate?
Would a missionary who is new to the area benefit from your record of your efforts to find new people to teach?
If you were to review your app right now, would it help you know where people are?
Would it help you know about their progress?
District Council, Zone Conferences, and Mission Leadership Council
Invite missionaries to share experiences with goals they have set and plans they have made to help people progress.
Examples might include goals and plans to help people:
Develop greater faith in the Savior.
Repent and make changes to come closer to God.
Be baptized and confirmed.
Come back to the Church and renew their baptismal covenant.
Read one of the following situations to the missionaries.
Have the missionaries divide into small groups.
Have each group use
steps 1 and 2
in the goal-setting process to help the people in these examples progress toward baptism and confirmation.
Have each group share their ideas.
A person you are teaching has accepted an invitation to attend church this week.
A person has accepted a baptismal invitation and has set a goal with you to be baptized.
A person has accepted your invitation to read the Book of Mormon and has committed to read
1 Nephi 1
.
Invite missionaries to use the Preach My Gospel app to help them set realistic but stretching goals by:
Reviewing past key indicator history and progress.
Setting daily, weekly, and monthly goals.
Adding people to key indicator goals.
Discuss how these steps can help missionaries plan more effectively as they help people progress.
Ask the missionaries to consider the following:
How will you use the Preach My Gospel app in the future as you plan?
What other ways have you discovered to use the app more effectively?
Mission Leaders and Mission Counselors
Frequently review the missionaries’ Preach My Gospel app.
Invite them to share how they use it to track their goals and plans and to help people progress.
Occasionally observe missionaries’ weekly or daily planning sessions.
Appendix 1
Apply the Goal-Setting Process in Working with People You Are Teaching
This section provides examples of how you might apply the goal-setting process to help people you are teaching.
1.
Set Goals and Make Plans
Prayerfully consider the spiritual needs of people you are teaching.
Set goals and make plans to help them fulfill these needs.
Use the Preach My Gospel app to review each person’s progress.
Use the key indicators for conversion to identify actions that will help each person take the next step in coming unto Christ.
As you set goals and make plans, ask yourselves questions like these:
What choices is the person making that show a growing faith in Jesus Christ?
What experiences is the person having with the Spirit?
What challenges might he or she be facing?
What more can we learn from this person to help him or her?
What needs to happen to help this person develop faith in Jesus Christ, feel and recognize the Spirit, repent, and be baptized?
How can we prepare for the ward’s weekly coordination meeting to include ward leaders and members in helping this person? (See
chapter 13
.)
What key indicator goals can we set that reflect our faith in the Lord?
2.
Record and Schedule Your Plans
Use the Preach My Gospel app to record and schedule your goals and plans in detail.
This will help you organize the work and identify actions to take each day.
Follow data privacy laws for your area.
As you record and schedule your plans, ask yourselves questions like these:
What specific things can we do today and this week to support this person’s progress?
What doctrine (or lesson) will help this person develop stronger faith in Christ and live the gospel?
How could we teach this doctrine so he or she understands it and is edified by the Holy Ghost?
How and when will we confirm appointments?
What invitations should we extend or follow up on?
How and when will we follow up?
How and when will we help the person attend church, read the scriptures, pray, and keep commitments that lead to making covenants with God?
How can members participate?
What online resources could we share with the person?
What backup plans can we make if something doesn’t go as planned?
3.
Act on Your Plans
Have a prayer in your heart throughout the day as you act on your plans.
The Spirit will help you know where to go, what to do, what to say, and what adjustments to make.
During the day, ask yourselves questions like these:
How can we work with faith, trusting the Lord to help us and magnify our efforts to serve His children?
How can we be creative and courageous when acting on our plans?
How can we adapt our plans according to people’s needs and circumstances?
Plans will not always go as you hope.
Be flexible and use backup plans when needed.
4.
Review Progress and Follow Up
With your companion, review progress toward the goals you have set to teach people and help them progress.
Plan ways to follow up.
Adjust your plans as needed as you strive to reach your goals.
Ask yourselves questions like these:
Are the people we are teaching moving toward making covenants with God?
What challenges do they face?
What are their concerns?
What can we do today to help them and encourage them to act—in person or through technology?
Are they having experiences with feeling the Spirit?
Are they connected to Church leaders and members and building friendships?
Who could participate the next time we teach?
What can we learn from setbacks?
How well did we do in reaching our goals?
Is there anything we should adjust or do differently?
Is it time for less frequent contact?
See
chapter 11
for more principles and ideas on how to follow up and help people progress.
Appendix 2
Apply the Goal-Setting Process in Finding People to Teach
This section provides examples of how you might apply the goal-setting process in finding new people to teach.
Use this process in your weekly and daily planning.
1.
Set Goals and Make Plans
With your companion, prayerfully consider what Heavenly Father would have you do to find more people to teach.
Do this each week and each day.
Have faith that He is preparing people for you (see
Doctrine and Covenants 100:3–8
).
Set finding goals each day.
Make plans for actions in your control that influence key indicator outcomes.
Examples include:
How many new people you will talk with about the gospel each day.
How many times you will ask members, people you are teaching, and people you contact if they know someone who might be interested in your message.
How quickly you will respond to referrals or comments on social media posts.
Review the Preach My Gospel app and ask yourselves questions like these:
What would Heavenly Father have us do today and this week to find people to teach?
What daily and weekly key indicator goals can we set to find people to teach?
Which finding activity is best for this time of day and location?
How can we inspire and support ward members in their efforts to share the gospel through the principles of loving, sharing, and inviting?
Which new members can we contact to help them attend sacrament meeting?
Do they have any friends they might invite?
How can we work with the ward council or participants in the ward’s weekly coordination meeting to identify part-member families, returning members, and prospective elders to contact?
Which people currently being taught, people formerly taught, and referred people can we contact?
How will we contact them? (In person, through technology, by phone, or in other ways)
What are some new ways we can find people?
What personal talents and strengths can we use?
How can we improve our ability to find people to teach?
How can we help those we contact feel the influence of the Holy Ghost?
For examples of finding activities, see
chapters 9
,
10
, and
13
.
Use the Preach My Gospel app to help you identify finding activities that have been effective in the past.
For example, you can see how recent converts were found.
Seek inspiration and be open to new impressions and ideas.
Avoid getting stuck in a routine.
Missionaries who consistently find new people to teach often use a variety of ways each week.
They work at it constantly.
2.
Record and Schedule Your Plans
With your companion, use the Preach My Gospel app to record and schedule your goals and plans in detail.
Recording and scheduling your plans will help you identify what actions to take and when to take them.
Ask yourselves questions like these:
When and how will we contact people?
What are the best approaches?
Where are the best locations?
What are the best times of day for the different ways of finding people?
How can we have meaningful conversations with people we meet?
How and when will we find online using social media and other technology?
When will we contact referrals?
What backup plans will we make for when other plans fall through?
3.
Act on Your Plans
Diligently strive to achieve your goals to find people to teach.
Have a prayer in your heart throughout the day.
Be open to greeting and speaking to people you meet.
The Spirit will help you know where to go, what to do, what to say, and what adjustments to make.
During the day, ask yourselves questions like these:
How can we work with faith, trusting the Lord to help us and magnify our efforts to serve His children?
How can we be creative and courageous when acting on our plans?
How can we adapt our plans according to people’s needs and circumstances?
How can we help people feel the influence of the Holy Ghost?
Plans will not always go as you hope.
Be flexible and use backup plans when needed.
4.
Review Progress and Follow Up
Throughout the day and week, prayerfully review progress in reaching your goals to find people to teach.
Ask yourselves questions like these:
How well did we do in reaching our goals and following our plans?
What adjustments should we make to meet our goals to find people?
How can we avoid slipping into a routine that is not effective in finding people to teach?
What is something new we can try during this time of day?
What are some ideas we can discuss in the ward’s weekly coordination meeting to help us find people to teach? (See
chapter 13
.)
As a companionship, use the “
Finding Efforts
” chart in chapter 9 to evaluate your weekly and daily finding efforts.
Recognize those things you are doing well, and consider how you can improve.
Throughout the day, pause for a few minutes to recognize God’s hand in your work.

The Good Shepherd, by Del Parson
Chapter 9
Find People to Teach
Consider This
How can I exercise faith in Christ to find people to teach?
How can we expand our vision and improve our plans for finding people to teach?
How can I grow in my ability and confidence to talk with the people I meet each day?
How can we unite with members in sharing the gospel?
What should we do when we receive referrals?
What are some ideas for finding people to teach that we have not yet tried?
The resurrected Savior told His disciples, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (
Matthew 28:19
; see also
Mark 16:15
).
The Lord repeated this commission in our day, saying, “Go ye into all the world [and] preach the gospel” (
Doctrine and Covenants 68:8
; see also
50:14
).
Missionary work is finding people, teaching them, and helping them prepare for baptism.
You will fulfill the Lord’s commission to teach His gospel and baptize converts as you “find them that will receive you” (
Doctrine and Covenants 42:8
).
Nothing happens in missionary work until you find someone to teach.
Watch all the time for opportunities to introduce the gospel.
Learn to use the ways that are effective in your area.
It is especially important to work with members in finding.
Work hard to earn their trust.
When members trust missionaries, they are more likely to invite their friends and family members to meet with you.
These people are more likely to be converted unto the Lord, be baptized, and progress on the gospel path.
Finding will happen according to a person’s readiness to hear the gospel.
The timing will be different for each person.
Finding can result from a first-time interaction or from many interactions over an extended time.
Many people have several interactions with the missionaries or Church members before beginning a serious study of the gospel.
Do not hesitate to contact them again.
Your efforts to find may bear fruit after you have been transferred or even after you have finished your mission.
Regardless of the timing or the outcome, the Lord is grateful for your efforts.
This chapter outlines principles and ideas to help you find.
These principles are universal.
However, missionaries and mission leaders may need to adapt them to their circumstances.
Exercise Faith to Find People to Teach
Wherever you serve, the Lord has called you to labor “for the salvation of souls” (
Doctrine and Covenants 100:4
).
To do this, you need to exercise faith in Christ to find people to teach so they can choose to follow Him and be baptized.
Faith is a principle of action and power.
Have faith that the Lord is preparing people to receive the restored gospel.
Have patient confidence that He will lead you to them, or them to you.
Act on your faith by setting goals, making plans, and carrying out your plans to find people to teach (see
chapter 8
).
Image
missionaries praying
Pray with faith as you seek God’s help to find people to teach.
When Alma led a mission to the Zoramites, he prayed: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ.
Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious … ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring [them] again unto thee” (
Alma 31:34–35
).
The people you meet often do not realize that they are looking for the restored gospel until they have found it.
For example, one convert said, “When I heard the gospel, it filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t know was there.” Another said, “I have finished the search I didn’t know I was on.” Others are actively looking for the truth but do not know where to find it (see
Doctrine and Covenants 123:12
).
Seek the guidance of the Spirit as you look for people to teach.
Finding by the Spirit is as important as teaching by the Spirit.
Have faith that you will know how to find those who will receive you.
Companion Study
There may be members in your area who are converts to the Church.
Ask how they came in contact with the Church.
Their answers may give you insights into how to find.
Also ask how they came to know that the missionaries were teaching them the truth.
Summarize their experiences in your study journal.
Scripture Study
How are God’s children prepared and led to the restored gospel?
Alma 16:16–17
Doctrine and Covenants 33:6
;
84:45–47, 88
;
136:32–33
Expand Your Vision of Planning to Find
As you seek to find people to teach, be aware of the difference between
scheduling
and
planning
.
Scheduling
is filling up your planner and your day.
Planning
is making a prayerful, purposeful effort to focus on people and the best ways to find them.
The right activity, at the right time and in the right location, can help you find people to teach.
Ask yourself the following questions:
Where might we meet people the Lord may be preparing?
What are the best places and types of activities to find people at specific times of the day or week?
How can we show love, serve them, or bring value to their lives right now?
How can we use personal strengths, skills, and talents to uplift them?
What are our backup plans if something doesn’t work out?
Try to recognize ways that the Lord is preparing people.
Are they willing to talk with you?
Are they seeking help or comfort?
Think about finding efforts that have been successful.
Where was the first interaction?
Did the efforts include local members?
Was technology used?
Begin your planning by focusing on how you can bless people, and then your schedule will take shape.
Companion Study
With your companion, use the table below to evaluate your efforts in finding people to teach.
Plan to try some of the ideas that are new to you.
Finding Efforts
Sometimes
Often
Almost Always
We get to know members and support them in their efforts to share the gospel, including new members, youth, those who are preparing to serve missions, returning missionaries, part-member families, and prospective elders.
We work to earn members’ trust so they will be comfortable inviting their family members and friends to meet with us.
We work with ward leaders in weekly coordination meetings to support our finding efforts and find out if there are people we could contact.
We work with current people being taught, people formerly taught, and media-referred people to find.
We talk with as many people as we can each day.
We spiritually prepare and pray for God’s help as we plan to find people to teach.
We believe that the Lord is preparing people for us to teach.
We consider how to help those we meet feel the influence of the Holy Ghost.
We set specific weekly and daily finding goals (see chapter 8).
We are constantly looking for people to teach.
We are creative and use a variety of ways to find people.
We try new ways and avoid getting stuck in a routine.
We plan specifically to find.
We plan when, where, and how we will focus.
We consider what the best locations and times of day might be to find people to teach.
We consider what finding activities have been effective in the past.
We adjust our finding plans as needed and have backup plans when scheduled events fall through.
We use the Preach My Gospel app to find, to set goals and make plans, and to review and update our records daily.
We use our personal talents and strengths to help find.
We plan when and how we will use social media and other technology to find people to teach.
We use the media campaigns and local offerings that meet the interests and needs of people in our area.
We respond quickly to online requests and messages from people who might be interested.
We plan our social media posts in advance and work with members to find online.
Be Diligent in Finding
Make Finding a Constant Effort
In the early days of the restored Church, the Lord repeatedly instructed a group of brethren to teach His gospel “by the way” as they traveled.
He wanted them to use every opportunity to share the gospel. (See
Doctrine and Covenants 52:9–10, 22–23, 25–27
.)
Apply this instruction to your finding.
Make a diligent effort to find throughout the day.
Plan your finding efforts—and also look for unplanned opportunities.
Finding new people to teach is a constant need.
Seek inspiration and be willing to use a variety of ways.
Focus on the ways that are most effective in your area.

Keep Lines in the Water
Concerning the work of missionaries, President Dallin H.
Oaks said:
“None of us should be like the fisherman who thinks he has been fishing all day when in reality he has spent most of his time getting to and from the water, eating lunch, and fussing with his equipment.
Fishing success is related to how long you have your line in the water, not to how long you are away from the apartment.
Some fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for ten hours.
Other fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for only two hours.
This last type may wonder why they do not have the same success as others.
“The same principle applies to missionaries, whom the Master called ‘fishers of men’ [
Matthew 4:19
].
A missionary’s line should drop into the fishing water the moment he or she leaves the apartment” (seminar for new mission presidents, June 20, 2000).
Image
multiple fishing rods
Elder Quentin L.
Cook expanded on this comparison.
In addition to keeping your “line in the water” for longer periods of time, he taught that missionaries who find people to teach “consistently keep
multiple
lines in the water. …
“They identify and contact part-member families.
“They search their [Preach My Gospel app] for people who have been taught in the past to contact by phone and text.
“They offer service to members, people who have been taught in the past, current people they are teaching, and the community at large. …
“They help members create gospel messages to share on their own … social media platforms.
“They obtain referrals from the people they visit and teach” (“Be Spiritual Pathfinders and Influencers,” missionary devotional, Sept. 10, 2020; emphasis added).
Companion Study
Discuss the following questions:
What are some ways you can keep your “line in the water” longer during the day?
What are some ways you can keep multiple lines in the water as you find people to teach?
What features in the Preach My Gospel app can help you?
How might you use technology to help you keep multiple lines in the water?
Talk with Everyone
Develop a deep desire to bring souls to Christ (see
Mosiah 28:3
).
When you feel this desire, your love and concern will be reflected in your efforts to find.
Your love will also be reflected in your conversations.
Talk with as many people as you can each day.
Talk with them wherever you go.
Where appropriate, go from home to home.
The Lord instructed some of the early elders of the Church, “Open your mouth to declare my gospel.” He then promised that their mouths would “be filled” with what to teach (
Doctrine and Covenants 30:5
; see also
33:7–10
).
Similarly, the Lord told Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, “Lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts.” He then promised, “It shall be given you … in the very moment, what ye shall say” (
Doctrine and Covenants 100:5–6
).
As you meet people, often you will feel the Spirit help you know what to say.
However, if you do not feel a prompting, just start somewhere—perhaps by asking a question and listening to their response (see “
Find People Where They Are
” in this chapter).
Or perhaps speak of the Lord Jesus Christ or of Joseph Smith’s calling to be a prophet of God.
The following ideas can help as you talk with those you meet:
Be warm, authentic, and friendly.
Look for ways to connect with the person and begin a conversation.
Listen sincerely to what people say.
Seek to understand each person’s needs and interests.
Offer personal help as appropriate.
Consider how the gospel can help meet their needs.
Then teach a basic gospel truth and invite them to learn more.
Share how the restored gospel can bring greater hope and meaning into their lives.
Ask about their families.
Help them see how the restored gospel can bless their families.
Offer to help them find the names of their deceased ancestors.
Invite them to come to sacrament meeting.
Offer pamphlets or other Church materials, both printed and digital.
Share with them your purpose as a missionary and why you decided to serve a mission.
These principles also apply to your interactions with members.
It is natural to be somewhat apprehensive about talking with people.
Pray for faith and courage to teach the restored gospel.
Everyone you meet is your brother or sister in the family of God.
Remember that He “denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; … all are alike unto God” (
2 Nephi 26:33
).
Personal or Companion Study
Read the account from Victor Manuel Cabrera in “
Thirsting for the Living Water
,”
Ensign
, Aug.
2001, 60–61.
As you do, look for how he was prepared to receive the missionaries and how the missionaries used an unplanned opportunity to teach him the gospel.
How had the man been prepared for the restored gospel?
What would have happened if the elders had not shared a gospel message?
Review what you did yesterday.
Did you talk with as many people as you could?
If not, set goals and make plans to talk with more people today.

What can you learn from the following scriptures about finding people to teach?
What can you learn from these scriptures about what you should teach?
What does the Lord promise?
Doctrine and Covenants 24:12
;
28:16
;
33:7–15
;
60:2–3, 7
Unite with Members
“Inviting all to receive the gospel is part of the work of salvation and exaltation” (
General Handbook
,
23.0
).
Work with members of the Church to find people to teach.
When members refer someone to you and then participate in the lessons, people are more likely to be baptized and remain active in the Church.
Build Strong Relationships with Local Leaders
Build strong relationships with the bishopric and other ward leaders.
The ward mission leader (if one is called) and the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies are your primary points of contact.
Seek their guidance, and support them in the weekly coordination meetings (see
chapter 13
).
During weekly coordination meetings, work with the priests quorum assistant and Young Women class president for the oldest class.
These youth have an important role in sharing the gospel.
Help them encourage quorum and class members to share the gospel.
One way is for youth to invite friends to activities.
Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing to local leaders?” Develop an attitude of “How can I help?” Like Ammon in the Book of Mormon, approach local leaders with an attitude of service (see
Alma 17:23–25
).
To mission leaders, President Russell M.
Nelson taught: “I hope that you will learn to love the local leaders and members.
Lift them and inspire them.
Your ability to link the enthusiasm of the missionaries with the stability and loving efforts of the members cannot be overemphasized.
Your success will be multiplied exponentially” (“Hopes of My Heart,” seminar for new mission leaders, June 23, 2019).

Support Members in Their Efforts to Share the Gospel
There are many ways to support and encourage members in sharing the gospel.
Help them reflect on how the gospel has blessed their lives.
Encourage them to “hold up [their] light that it may shine unto the world” (
3 Nephi 18:24
).
Help members apply the principles of love, share, and invite.
Give examples of normal and natural ways they can apply these principles.
Love.
One way to show love for God is by loving and serving His children.
Encourage members to reach out with love to family members, friends, neighbors, and others.
Any effort to express love is an important way to keep covenants they have made with God (see
Mosiah 18:9–10
).
Share.
Because of their love for God and His children, members naturally want to share the blessings He has given them (see
John 13:34–35
).
Encourage members to tell others about how the gospel blesses their lives.
Encourage them to speak of the Savior and His influence.
Help them feel the joy of sharing their love, time, and life events.
Help them learn how to share in normal and natural ways—simply as part of what they are already doing in their lives.

Elder Gary E.
Stevenson
“We all share things with others.
We do it often.
We share what movies and food we like, funny things we see, places we visit, art we appreciate, quotes we’re inspired by.
“How might we simply add to the list of things we already share what we love about the gospel of Jesus Christ? … By sharing our positive experiences in the gospel with others, we take part in fulfilling the Savior’s great commission” (Gary E.
Stevenson, “
Love, Share, Invite
,”
Liahona
, May 2022, 86).
Invite.
The Savior invites all to receive His gospel and prepare for eternal life (see
Alma 5:33–34
).
As with sharing, inviting is often a matter of simply including family, friends, and neighbors in what members are already doing.
Encourage members to pray about inviting people in the following ways:
Come and see.
Invite people to “come and see” the blessings they can receive through Jesus Christ, His gospel, and His Church.
Come and serve.
Invite people to “come and serve” others in need.
Come and belong.
Invite people to “come and belong” as members of the restored Church of Jesus Christ.
Elder Gary E.
Stevenson said: “There are hundreds of invitations we can extend to others.
We can invite others to ‘come and see’ a sacrament service, a ward activity, an online video that explains the gospel of Jesus Christ. ‘Come and see’ can be an invitation to read the Book of Mormon or visit a new temple during its open house prior to its dedication.
Sometimes the invitation is something we extend inward—an invitation to ourselves, giving us awareness and vision of opportunities surrounding us to act upon” (“
Love, Share, Invite
,” 86).
Be sure to help youth love, share, and invite.
Youth are especially gifted at loving their friends, sharing what is in their heart, and inviting them to activities.
Help members understand that any effort to live the principles of love, share, and invite is positive, whether or not a person meets with the missionaries or joins the Church.
Help members draw on their strengths in sharing the gospel.
Some are great at finding people to teach, and some are great teachers.
Some have a natural ability to connect with friends, while others love to pray for their friends.
Help them see that there are ways for everyone to participate.
When you visit members, do so with a purpose.
Show that you are anxiously engaged in the work of finding and teaching.
Respect their time and schedule.
Some members might welcome having you teach a message from one of the lessons.
The truths of the gospel are life changing.
Strengthening members’ understanding of the gospel will increase their trust in you and build their excitement to share it.
Help them recognize the Spirit and act on promptings.
Seek to find people to teach through part-member families, prospective elders, returning members, and new members.
They will likely have many family members and friends of other faiths.
In all you do with members, follow the Spirit and seek to build their faith in the Savior, Jesus Christ.

Companion Study
Review your last weekly coordination meeting.
How could you have made it more effective?
Review requests from ward leaders and plan how and when to respond.
Plan how you will coordinate your missionary efforts in the next coordination meeting.
Learn the names of ward leaders (men and women).
Plan what you will do during the next month to develop stronger relationships with them and support them in their missionary efforts.
Find through the Preach My Gospel App
The Preach My Gospel app is a great resource for finding people to teach.
Missionaries who consistently use the features in this app have more success finding.
To become acquainted with these features, refer to training provided within the app.
Be sensitive to spiritual promptings you may receive as you review the names of people.
The app includes information about people who were previously referred, contacted, or taught.
Some of these people might want to meet with missionaries again.
They might also know of other people who may be interested in learning about the gospel.
In your planning, use the map and filters in the app to prioritize which people to visit.
Look at their information and learn how they were found.
See if there is a record about members who helped them.
Use this information to determine how best to reach out to them again.
Image
missionaries studying on phones
Use the filters feature in the app to identify all those who:
Had a previously scheduled baptismal date but were not baptized.
Attended sacrament meeting at least once but were not baptized.
Received more than three lessons.
Have not been contacted recently.
If people you contact are not interested in being taught or choose to stop receiving visits, record that information in the app.
Record how you will keep in touch with them and nurture them until they are ready to learn more.
For example, consider inviting them to sign up for an email series to receive messages about Jesus Christ or other gospel topics.
You might also connect them with a member who can answer questions and nurture their interest and friendship.
Set a reminder in the app to follow up with them.
Ask if they know anyone else who might be interested.
You can also find people to teach through the Preach My Gospel app by using filters or groups to send group messages.
This can be a great way to let people know about events like ward activities and baptismal services.
Follow up with personal invitations to these events.
Companion Study
To see what a great resource the Preach My Gospel app can be in finding, try the following activities.
As you do, pay attention to the impressions you receive.
Using a filter, identify all the people who have been taught three or more lessons.
Individually invite them to attend church this Sunday.
Create a filter and find all those who had a baptismal date scheduled and attended church at least twice.
Plan to message people individually to join a ward activity or service project.
Occasionally you may want to send a group message and follow up with people individually.
Discuss with your companion those who you felt impressed about.
Make plans to visit or otherwise contact them soon.
Find through Service
Provide Opportunities for People to Come and Serve
People can have positive experiences and connect with missionaries and local members at service activities.
Many people are happy to share their talents, skills, or services and just need to be invited.
Invite people to participate in service activities organized by the ward.
You can also connect people with service opportunities such as those on
JustServe.org
where it is available.
As you serve with others, you come together in a powerful way.
Offer Service
Like the Savior, “[go] about doing good” (
Acts 10:38
; see also “
Go about Doing Good
” in chapter 1).
Pray to be aware of opportunities to do good throughout each day.
Sometimes your service will be planned, but often it will be unplanned.
Find simple and immediate ways to serve, help, and lift people.
Remember that the Lord took unexpected opportunities to reach out and bless others.
Serve with a sincere desire to help people.
If the service leads to a teaching opportunity, be grateful.
If not, then be grateful to have done good for someone.
Answer questions if people ask them.
If someone expresses interest, reply briefly and arrange to meet at a different time to share a message.
Be sure to follow the guidelines for service in
Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ
,
2.7
and
7.2
.
Find People Where They Are
Finding people where they are begins with trying to see them as God does.
Assume that you may have been led to talk with this person, or he or she may have been led to you.
Seek to understand people’s spiritual needs and desires.
Find out what is most important to them, especially in their relationships with family and God.
You might ask questions like those below—and then sincerely listen:
What do you value most?
What gives you joy?
What do you want for your own future and for those you love?
What challenges do you face in reaching your hopes and dreams?
What aspects of your life do you want to improve?
Seek inspiration as you reflect on what you learn about the person’s hopes and desires.
What gospel truths naturally connect with what he or she wants?
Consider your approach from that person’s perspective.
What does he or she know about you?
What can you offer that might be helpful?
Does the person feel that an interaction with you will be worthwhile?
Consider different reasons people might want to get to know you, other members, or the Church.
Some examples of what you can provide are outlined below.
Image
missionaries talking to woman
Give Experiences or Information They Would Value
Use Church resources and your own talents and strengths to connect with someone’s interests.
Seek Heavenly Father’s help in offering information or experiences the person will value.
Be open to inspiration and be creative as you think about different kinds of experiences or information you can provide.
Some ideas are listed below.
Share a link to a Church resource that provides information about something that would interest them.
Host an event like a devotional (in person or streaming live).
Offer something at a local gathering or event (for example, create free family history trees at a local market).
Offer to teach a class.
Organize a scripture study class, or offer to read the Bible and other scriptures with them.
Teach English as a second language.
Publicize local Church activities like a holiday party or self-reliance classes.
Use flyers or social media.
Invite them to a baptismal service.
Offer to give them a tour of the local meetinghouse.
One of the most valuable experiences you can help people have is attending a Church service.
Invite them and explain what it will be like.
Tell them how attending a sacrament meeting will bless their lives.
Facilitate Genuine Relationships
Many people would like to meet others in their community or get to know them better.
Some people are lonely.
Some ideas for helping facilitate genuine relationships are listed below.
Visit people who have recently moved into the area to welcome them.
Introduce people in the community to members who have shared interests.
Invite people to ward meetings, activities, and open houses.
Offer to help them connect with the ward temple and family history leader, who can help them learn more about their deceased family members.
Offer to teach people how to hold home evening or read the scriptures as a family. (See
General Handbook
,
2.2.4
, for helpful principles that can be adapted to people’s circumstances.)
Invite people of the appropriate age to attend seminary, attend institute, or participate in BYU–Pathway Worldwide.
There are many honorable ways to find those who are being prepared for the restored gospel.
Do what you can to be placed in the path of those who are being prepared.
Companion Study
Identify some ideas in this section that you have not tried.
Make plans to try some of the ideas during the next week.
Contact People Referred to You
People referred to you may be ready to receive the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Referrals may come from members of the Church, other missionaries, Church headquarters, and local social media efforts.
Reach Out Promptly
When a person is referred to you through headquarters or local social media, review the information in the Preach My Gospel app about their interests.
Attempt to contact them as soon as possible.
Image
missionary knocking on door
Use the following guidelines when working with people referred to you:
If the person was referred by a member or by other missionaries, contact the person who sent the referral to learn more.
If missionaries referred the person, they may teach with you virtually if their mission leader approves.
Members may join you in person or virtually to participate in teaching.
Promptly attempt to contact the person through a visit, call, text, email, or other form of communication.
If the person does not respond, try to contact him or her at a different time of day.
If your initial contact was by call, text, or email, arrange a time to meet in person or through technology.
As a companionship, review the person’s request and identify his or her needs and interests.
Determine how the gospel can help meet those needs.
When you meet, bring any requested items, such as the Book of Mormon.
Share gospel truths from the missionary lessons that meet the person’s interests or needs.
Sometimes people who are referred can lead you to others whom God is preparing.
If the people you contact are not interested, ask if they know others who might be interested or who need hope in their lives.
Perhaps you have been led to this person because someone else in the home or neighborhood is ready for the gospel.
If an appointment with someone falls through, consider how you can do other missionary work in the area.
The Preach My Gospel app can help you find people nearby who were previously contacted or taught.
Refer People to Missionaries in Another Area
When you meet people who are interested in learning more about the gospel but live outside your assigned area, introduce them to the gospel.
Then help them prepare to meet missionaries and members where they live.
With your mission president’s approval, you may continue to support these people to help them receive the gospel (see
Missionary Standards
,
7.5.4
).
Companion Study
Review all the people who have been referred in your area within the last month.
Identify any people you have been unable to contact, and try to contact them again.
Decide which of those who have been contacted should be visited again.
Update these records in the Preach My Gospel app.

Use Technology
There are many ways you can use technology to find people to teach.
Some examples are listed below:
Use social media to work with members to find people.
Build relationships by reaching out through email and social media.
Share uplifting scriptures, quotes, and gospel messages.
Help people use
FamilySearch.org
to learn more about their deceased family members.
Offer online classes to teach skills.
Make appropriate connections through shared online interest groups.
Create a post that tells about upcoming ward events.
Using technology is an important way to keep “multiple lines in the water” throughout the day.
In addition to your other finding efforts, keep multiple internet lines in the water.
Image
Elder David A.
Bednar
Elder David A.
Bednar taught: “Technology provides a multitude of powerful channels through which we can proclaim ‘Jesus Christ, and him crucified’ and ‘preach repentance unto the people’ [
1 Corinthians 2:2
;
Doctrine and Covenants 44:3
].
The rising generation is especially well prepared to hear and learn about the restored gospel through these means of communication” (“They Should Proclaim These Things unto the World,” seminar for new mission presidents, June 24, 2016).
Companion Study
Find out what your mission is doing with social media.
Discuss with your companion how you could create social media posts that align with this.
Your posts should comply with Church internet policy (see “
Internet
” in section 38.8 of the
General Handbook
).
If your mission has a social media specialist, draw on his or her expertise as you create social media posts.
Image

Use Family History
Family history is another way you can find people to teach.
Throughout the world, the Spirit is influencing millions of people to identify their deceased ancestors.
Many want a stronger connection with their extended family.
This can lead to a desire to find a connection and identity as part of God’s family.
What we sometimes refer to as the spirit of Elijah is the influence of the Holy Ghost drawing people to identify, document, and cherish their family members—both past and present (see
Malachi 4:5–6
).
In your finding, you might introduce people to FamilySearch.org or invite them to download the FamilySearch Tree app or the FamilySearch Memories app.
You could also give them a copy of the booklet
My Family: Stories That Bring Us Together
.
These resources help people discover relatives and ancestors and gather their stories.
Determine what family history resources are available in your area and how they could help the people you contact.
The ward temple and family history leader can help people identify their deceased ancestors.
Invite people to share memories of their loved ones with you.
As they do, they may feel the Holy Ghost testify to them about the importance of families in God’s plan.
These moments can lead to natural conversations about the purpose of life, God’s plan of happiness, and the role of the Savior in that plan.
When appropriate, teach people the doctrine about why Church members do family history work and how it relates to temples.
Pray to be aware of opportunities to use family history in your finding efforts.
Be creative, and become familiar with available resources.
Scripture Study
Study the following scriptures about family history.
Record what you learn.

Personal or Companion Study
Try one or more of the following activities to help you find through family history.
Arrange to visit with a member who has experience with family history.
Learn what services are available through your ward temple and family history leader.
Practice how you will offer family history help to those you meet.
Make plans to offer family history in your finding efforts.
Read and discuss the
Families and Temples
booklet to gain a stronger understanding of family history work.
Write what you learn in your study journal.
Use the
My Family
booklet or
FamilySearch.org
resources as you find people to teach.
Where possible, hold an open house, teach a family history class in a public place, or offer consultations.
Find When You Teach
Finding and teaching are related activities.
People you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel.
As the people you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see
1 Nephi 8:12
).
In all situations—such as finding, teaching, and working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would benefit from this message?”
When those you teach are preparing for their baptismal service, ask them about family and friends they would like to invite to their baptism.
Make plans to invite and encourage all to come.
The Spirit can be powerfully felt during a baptismal service.
Companion Study
Review a list of people you are teaching.
Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked.
Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group.
In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits.
Image

Teach When You Find
As you meet people and identify their interests and needs, develop the habit of beginning to teach and share your testimony.
You will find more people to teach as you testify of the Savior and His gospel and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost.
Consider teaching on topics such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death.
Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Savior, His gospel, and His call to the Prophet Joseph Smith.
This is our unique message to the world.
The following sections provide examples of how you might briefly teach about the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the importance of the family.
Teach and Testify about the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
Testify of Jesus Christ and teach brief summaries of restored truth.
For example, you can testify of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in just two or three sentences:
After centuries of being lost, truths have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet.
We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read, and ponder in your heart.
We invite you to read and pray to learn its truth for yourself.
Will you allow us to …
If you have a little more time, you might say more:
Our message is simple.
God is our Father.
We are His children.
We are part of His family.
He knows us personally and loves us.
He wants us to experience joy.
From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of reaching out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so His children can know how to return to Him.
He has revealed the gospel to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses.
But many people repeatedly chose to reject the gospel and the prophets who taught it.
Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel.
People even rejected Jesus.
After the deaths of Jesus’s Apostles, people distorted true doctrine, such as about the Godhead.
They also changed ordinances, such as baptism.
Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure.
Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrine and ordinances to a prophet.
This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith.
The evidence of this truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon.
You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.
We invite you to attend church to learn more.
Teach and Testify about the Importance of the Family
Addressing the importance of the family will help you find people to teach, whether they have a Christian background or a non-Christian one.
You can quickly relate what most people know about the family to Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation.
You might say something like this:
Our family can be one of the most important influences in our lives.
Our family ties us to one another and can help us feel needed and loved.
Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people.
Having a strong marriage and raising children in today’s world can be very challenging.
You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration:
You have been part of God’s family since before you were born.
He is our Father.
Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him.
You are His child, and He loves you.
He has a plan to help you return to Him.
These truths and others have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet.
These truths help us understand our place in God’s family.
May we teach you more about these truths?
Will you attend church so you can learn more?
Companion Study
Prepare a one-minute message based on one of the lessons in
chapter 3
.
Practice sharing it with each other.
Think of ways you might share this message in a finding situation.
Plan to share it in an appropriate situation to invite others to learn more about Jesus Christ.
No Effort Is Wasted
When people choose not to learn more about the restored gospel, your efforts are not wasted.
Perhaps you have planted a seed that will grow at another time.
Whether that happens or not, your service and expressions of genuine love will bless both you and them.
If people are not ready to receive the gospel, see what else you can do to enrich their lives.
The relationships you develop are still meaningful and valuable.
Continue to be a friend.
People sometimes need time to consider the changes that are asked of them.
Help them receive messages through Church emails or websites.
These messages might help prepare people to accept future invitations to learn more.
When a person does not accept the gospel, it is natural to be disappointed.
However, as you turn to the Lord in such times, He has promised, “I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee” (
Isaiah 41:10
).
Through faith in Christ, you can find peace and reassurance about your efforts.
Maintain a vision of who you are and why you are serving the Lord as a missionary.
Faith will help you press forward and continue in righteous desires.
Remember This
Finding people to teach should be a constant effort.
Exercise faith and expand your vision to find people to teach.
Keep multiple lines in the water.
Unite with members in finding people to teach.
Build strong relationships, and support them in their efforts to share the gospel.
Determine which ways of finding are most effective in your area, and use a variety of ways.
Prioritize activities that are more likely to help you find people who are being prepared to receive the gospel.
Pray for opportunities to do good and to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Sermon on the Mount, by Harry Anderson
Chapter 10
Teach to Build Faith in Jesus Christ
Consider This
How can I teach by the Spirit?
How can I teach from the scriptures?
How should I share my testimony when teaching?
How can I plan and adjust my teaching to meet people’s needs?
How can I ask better questions and be a better listener?
How can I help people find answers to their questions and receive guidance and strength?
You are called to teach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to as many people as will receive you.
Teaching is central to everything you do.
As you rely on the Lord for help, He has promised:
“And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face.
I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up” (
Doctrine and Covenants 84:88
).
Pray, study, and practice to improve your teaching ability.
Apply the principles in this chapter and in other chapters of this book.
Earnestly seek the gift of teaching so you can bless others and glorify God.
The Lord will help you teach with power and authority as you diligently seek Him and learn His word.
Seek to Teach as the Savior Taught
During His earthly ministry, Jesus “went about … teaching … , preaching … , and healing” (
Matthew 4:23
).
He taught in many settings—in synagogues, in homes, and on the road.
He taught in large gatherings and in private conversations.
Some of His most powerful interactions were very brief or in unusual settings.
He taught through His actions as well as His words.
The Savior taught each person according to his or her unique needs.
For example, when serving a paralyzed man, He forgave his sins and healed him (see
Mark 2:1–12
).
When ministering to a woman who had committed adultery, He protected her and invited her to sin no more (see
John 8:2–11
).
When speaking with a rich man who desired eternal life, He “loved him” despite the young man’s refusal to accept His invitation to follow Him (
Mark 10:21
; see
verses 17–21
).
You can improve your teaching by learning how the Savior taught.
For example, He loved the Father and those He taught.
He was prayerful.
He taught from the scriptures.
He prepared spiritually.
He asked inspired questions.
He invited people to act in faith.
He likened gospel principles to everyday life.
Seeking to teach as the Savior taught is a lifelong pursuit.
It will come to you line upon line as you follow Him (see
2 Nephi 28:30
;
Ether 12:41
).
“Seek to Obtain My Word”
To teach the gospel of Jesus Christ, you need to know its basic doctrine and principles.
You also need spiritual knowledge and confirmation of gospel truths.
The Lord said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word.”
To “obtain” the Lord’s word means to study it and let it sink deep in your heart.
As you make this effort, He promised, “Then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (
Doctrine and Covenants 11:21
).
Image
person marking scriptures
The Lord also said to “treasure up in your minds continually the words of life” (
Doctrine and Covenants 84:85
).
Treasuring up the Lord’s words will increase your knowledge and strengthen your testimony.
Your desire and ability to teach the gospel will likewise increase. (See
Jacob 4:6–7
;
Alma 32:27–42
;
36:26
;
37:8–9
.)
Prayerfully obtain and treasure up the Lord’s word by studying the scriptures, the words of living prophets, and the lessons in
chapter 3
.
Teach by the Spirit
The gospel of Jesus Christ is “the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (
Romans 1:16
).
For that reason, the message of the Restoration of the gospel needs to be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost.
It is important that you develop teaching skills.
It is also important that you learn the doctrine and principles you teach.
However, when teaching spiritual truths, you do not rely primarily on your own abilities and knowledge.
Spiritual truths are taught by the power of the Holy Ghost.
The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (
Doctrine and Covenants 42:14
; see also
Doctrine and Covenants 50:13–14, 17–22
).
What It Means to Teach by the Spirit
When you teach by the Spirit, you pray to have the power of the Holy Ghost in your teaching.
You also pray that people will receive truths by the Spirit.
People may be persuaded of some truths, but to be converted, they need to have experiences with the Spirit (see
Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3
).
Prepare yourself to be an instrument through whom the Spirit can teach.
Think of the Holy Ghost as your companion in teaching.
Rely on the Spirit to help you know what to say.
He will bring the doctrine you have studied to your remembrance.
He will help you plan and adjust what you teach according to a person’s needs.
When you teach by the Spirit, He will carry your message unto people’s hearts.
He will confirm your message when you bear your testimony.
You and those who receive what you teach by the Spirit will be edified, understand one another, and rejoice together. (See
2 Nephi 33:1
;
Doctrine and Covenants 50:13–22
.)
Image
President Ezra Taft Benson
“The Spirit is the most important single element in this work.
With the Spirit magnifying your call, you can do miracles for the Lord in the mission field.
Without the Spirit, you will never succeed
regardless
of your talent and ability” (Ezra Taft Benson, seminar for new mission presidents, June 25, 1986).
The Promise of Your Calling
You have been called and set apart “to preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent forth to teach the truth” (
Doctrine and Covenants 50:14
).
At times you may feel nervous or inadequate.
Perhaps you worry that you do not know enough or that you do not have enough experience.
Your Heavenly Father, who knows you perfectly, called you because of what you can offer as a committed follower of Jesus Christ.
He will not forsake you.
Trust that the Spirit will magnify your abilities and will teach the truth to those who are receptive.
Image
Elder Neil L.
Andersen
Elder Neil L.
Andersen said: “As I contemplated the challenge of a mission, I felt very inadequate and unprepared.
I remember praying, ‘Heavenly Father, how can I serve a mission when I know so little?’ I believed in the Church, but I felt my spiritual knowledge was very limited.
As I prayed, the feeling came: ‘You don’t know everything, but you know enough!’ That reassurance gave me the courage to take the next step into the mission field” (“
You Know Enough
,”
Ensign
or
Liahona
, Nov.
2008, 13).
Invite the Spirit as You Begin Teaching
The first few moments with people are very important.
Be genuine and respectful.
Show sincere interest and love.
Seek to earn their trust.
One way to earn trust is when people feel the Spirit with you.
Ask a few simple questions to help you understand their background and their expectations about your visits.
Listen carefully.
Before you begin, invite all who are present to join in the lesson.
Encourage them to remove distractions so the Spirit of the Lord can be felt.
Explain that you would like to begin and end each lesson with prayer.
Offer to give the opening prayer.
Pray simply and sincerely that God will bless the people you are teaching in every aspect of their lives.
Pray that they can feel the truth of what you will teach.
Remember that the “fervent prayer of a righteous [person] availeth much” (
James 5:16
).
Have faith in the converting power of the Holy Ghost.
As guided by the Spirit, you may express thoughts such as the following as you begin teaching:
God is our loving Heavenly Father.
We are all brothers and sisters.
He wants us to experience joy.
We all have challenges and struggles.
No matter what you are going through, Jesus Christ and His teachings can help you.
He can help you find peace, hope, healing, and happiness.
Jesus can help you have greater strength for life’s challenges.
We all make mistakes, which can create feelings of guilt, shame, and regret.
These feelings will go away only as we repent and seek God’s forgiveness.
Only through the Atonement of Jesus Christ can we be fully healed from our sins.
We will be guides so you can learn the truth of our message for yourselves.
We will invite you to do some things, such as reading, praying, and attending church.
Our role is to help you act on these invitations and explain the blessings you can receive.
Please ask questions.
We have been called by a prophet of God to share what we know.
We know that our message is true.
We will teach you how to make covenants, or special promises, with God.
These covenants will connect you to God and allow you to receive joy, strength, and special promises from Him.
You will learn how to make changes in your life and follow Jesus Christ and His teachings.
One essential teaching of Jesus Christ, and the first covenant we make, is to follow His example and be baptized by proper authority (see
John 3:5
;
Doctrine and Covenants 22
).
Image
missionaries praying
Before teaching a lesson, give a simple overview of what you will teach.
Help people see how it will have relevance to them.
For example, you might say, “We are here to share the message that Jesus Christ has established His Church on the earth today and has called living prophets to guide us.” Or you might say, “We are here to help you know that God loves you and has a plan for your happiness.”
All people will benefit as they accept and live the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Heavenly Father may have blessed the people you find with valuable spiritual preparation (see
Alma 16:16–17
).
Inviting the Spirit and sharing truth in the first meeting will help people recognize you as servants of the Lord.
Personal or Companion Study
Use the suggestions in this section to practice different ways to begin a lesson.
Use the Scriptures
The standard works of the Church are your basic sources for teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
There are many reasons why it is vital to use the scriptures as the basis for your teaching.
For example:
The scriptures invite the Holy Ghost into your teaching (see
Luke 24:13–32
).
The scriptures have a more powerful effect on the minds of people than anything else (see
Alma 31:5
).
The scriptures address the great questions of the soul (see
chapter 5
; see also
2 Nephi 32:3
;
Jacob 2:8
).
The scriptures give authority and validity to your teaching.
The Lord and His prophets have said to do so (see
Doctrine and Covenants 42:12, 56–58
;
71:1
).
By using the scriptures in your teaching, you can help others begin to study the scriptures on their own.
As your love for the scriptures is evident, they will be encouraged to study.
Show how studying the scriptures will help them learn the gospel and feel God’s love.
Give examples of how the scriptures can help them find answers to their questions and receive guidance and strength.
Devote yourself to studying the scriptures so you can teach from them effectively (see
chapter 2
).
Your ability to teach from the scriptures will improve as you study them every day, both personally and with your companion.
Help people develop faith in Jesus Christ through studying the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon.
The following suggestions may help.
Image
group studying scriptures
Introduce the Scripture
Briefly describe the background of the passage.
The following examples show some ways to introduce a scripture:
“In Joseph Smith’s history, Joseph tells us in his own words what happened as he went into the grove to pray.
He said, ‘I saw a pillar of light …’”
“In this passage, the prophet Alma is teaching people who are poor to exercise their faith in the word of God.
He compares the word of God to a seed that can be planted in our hearts.
Will you begin reading verse … ?”
Read the Passage
Read the verses aloud or ask the person you are teaching to read aloud.
Be sensitive to those who struggle to read.
If a passage is difficult for them to understand, read with them and explain as needed.
Define any difficult words or phrases.
Or give them a simpler passage to read.
Invite them to look for particular points in the passage.
Apply the Scriptures
Nephi said, “I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning” (
1 Nephi 19:23
).
To “liken” means to apply the scriptures to your life.
Liken the scriptures to those you teach by showing how the stories and principles are relevant to them personally.
For example:
“Like you, the people of Alma had heavy burdens, almost more than they could bear.
But as they exercised faith and prayed, God strengthened them so they could endure the challenges.
Then He delivered them from their trials.
Just as He did with these people, I know God will help you in your trials as you …” (See
Mosiah 24
.)
“Alma’s instruction to the people at the Waters of Mormon applies to us today.
John, are you willing to … ?” (See
Mosiah 18
.)
Teach people how to “liken” the scriptures on their own.
Discovering personal applications will help them apply and experience the power of the word of God.
Invite and Help People to Read on Their Own
The people you teach need to read the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon, to gain a testimony of the truth.
By effectively using the scriptures in your teaching, you can help people begin to study the scriptures on their own.
After each visit, suggest specific chapters or verses for them to read.
Suggest questions for them to consider as they read.
Encourage them to study the scriptures daily on their own and with their families.
You might also ask members to read with them between lessons.
Before beginning the next lesson, follow up by discussing what you invited people to read.
As needed, help them understand and “liken” these scriptures.
Encourage them to record their thoughts and questions.
When you help people read, understand, and apply the scriptures—especially the Book of Mormon—they will have spiritual experiences with the word of God.
They will be more likely to read on their own and make the scriptures an important part of their lives.

Help People Access the Scriptures
The scriptures and the words of living prophets are available in more ways and more languages than ever before.
Learn what print and digital options are available to the people you teach.
Help people access the scriptures in ways that match their needs and preferences.
Consider the following:
Ask people which language they would like to read or listen to the scriptures in.
Those who struggle to read, or who struggle to understand what they read, may benefit from reading aloud together or listening to audio recordings.
These are available through free Church apps and websites.
If a person has a digital device, help him or her access the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon.
The Book of Mormon app and Gospel Library are free and easy to share.
If using text, chat, or email, send links or images of scriptures.
When teaching in video chat, consider sharing your screen so you can read verses together.
Help people access the words of the living prophets.
Personal or Companion Study
Make sure you and your companion have the updated scriptures resources on your phone, including the Book of Mormon app and the Gospel Library.
Select one of the following scripture passages:

Determine how you would:
Introduce the passage.
Provide background and context.
Read the passage and explain its meaning.
Explain difficult words.
Help those you teach apply it in their lives.

2 Timothy 3:15–17
Share Your Testimony
A testimony is a spiritual witness given by the Holy Ghost.
To share your testimony is to give a simple, direct declaration of knowledge or belief about a gospel truth.
Sharing your testimony adds your personal witness to the truths you have taught from the scriptures.
Sharing your testimony is a powerful way to invite the Spirit and help others feel His influence.
One of the missions of the Holy Ghost is to testify of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
He often fulfills this in companionship with you as you bear testimony.
A powerful testimony does not depend on eloquence or the volume of your voice—but on the conviction and sincerity of your heart.
Be careful not to rush or dramatize your testimony.
Give people a chance to feel the Holy Ghost bear witness to them that what you have taught is true.
Your testimony may be as simple as “Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer” or “I have learned for myself that the Book of Mormon is true.” You could also share a brief experience about how you gained this testimony.
When you teach, share your testimony as you feel prompted, not just at the end.
When your companion is teaching, share your testimony to provide a second witness of what he or she has taught.
Share your testimony that the principle you are teaching will bless the person’s life if he or she will follow it.
Tell how living the principle has blessed your life.
Your sincere testimony will help create an environment for people to feel the Holy Ghost confirm truth.
Personal Study
The following scripture passages are examples of bearing testimony.
Consider the questions as you read each scripture.
Record your answers in your study journal.
In these verses, what do Jesus and His apostles and prophets testify of?
How can you tell that they are convinced of the truth of what they are saying?
When you say, “I know that
is true,” what do you mean?
What other words can you use to express your convictions?

Plan and Adjust Your Teaching to Meet Needs
Each person you teach is unique.
Seek to understand his or her spiritual interests, needs, and concerns.
Ask questions and listen carefully.
Although you may not fully understand the person’s needs, remember that Heavenly Father does.
He will guide you through the Holy Ghost.
Image
missionaries teaching couple
Let the Spirit Guide the Order of the Lessons
Let the Spirit guide the order in which you teach the lessons.
You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in the order that is best for the needs, questions, and circumstances of those you teach.
Occasionally you might combine principles from different lessons to address a person’s needs and interests.
See the following three examples.
Yuki found you online and is asking why her friends in the Church do not smoke or drink.
You might teach her about the blessings of commandments by using the following sections from chapter 3:
Our Covenant to Keep the Commandments of God
Obey the Word of Wisdom
The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith
Samuel doesn’t feel like he belongs anywhere.
You might teach him about his identity and his place in God’s family by using the following sections from chapter 3:
God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father
Premortal Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us
The Gospel of Jesus Christ Blesses All of God’s Children
Tatyana has studied many religions and wants to know what makes the Church different.
You might teach her about the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ by using the following sections from chapter 3:
The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith
The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ
Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost
Heavenly Father knows His children, so seek inspiration to make these decisions as you prepare to teach.
Pray for the gift of discernment as you decide what to teach.
Pay attention to the thoughts and feelings that come to you.

Allow Time for People to Apply What They Are Learning
When you teach, allow time for people to apply what they are learning (see
3 Nephi 17:2–3
).
Look for appropriate ways to support them in keeping their commitments.
Focus on helping them with actions that will build a foundation of faith, such as praying, reading, and attending church.
This will enable them to keep additional commitments.
As you plan and teach, be sensitive about how much new information you share.
A primary objective of your teaching is to help a person build faith in Jesus Christ so it leads to repentance.
Your objective is not to see how much information you can dispense.
Teach at a pace that is appropriate for the person.
Ask questions and listen carefully so you understand how well he or she is learning and applying what you are teaching.
The truths you teach, coupled with the power of the Holy Ghost, can influence people to exercise their agency in ways that build their faith in Christ.
As they exercise faith in the Lord by applying what they learn, they will come to know by the Spirit that the gospel is true.
Use a Variety of Teaching Opportunities
Teaching opportunities take many forms, such as in-person visits, video chats, phone calls, text messages, and social media.
Respect People’s Time
Keep your teaching simple and brief.
People are more likely to meet with you when you respect their time and requests.
Ask how much time they have for the visit.
Start and end any conversation at the agreed time, whether teaching in person or online.
Be aware that in some places, phone calls or video chats can be expensive.
You will need multiple meetings to teach the principles in one lesson.
Typically a teaching visit should not be longer than 30 minutes, and you can teach a person in as few as 5 minutes.
Adjust your teaching according to people’s time.
Use Technology Wisely
You have many opportunities to teach people using technology.
Some people prefer the convenience or privacy of interacting through electronic means.
Even people you visit in person can benefit from additional support through technology.
Discuss the resources available to communicate.
Then follow up and stay connected.
Allow each person’s preferences to guide your interactions.
Technology such as video calls can be especially helpful for teaching people who have busy schedules or live far away.
Sometimes it is easier for members to participate in a lesson via technology.
Help Younger Learners
During the Savior’s ministry, He told His disciples, “Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God” (
Mark 10:14
).
When you teach children, adjust your approach and message to meet their needs.
Help them learn the gospel by discussing things that are familiar to them.
Ensure that they understand what you are teaching.
Scripture Study
Read
Doctrine and Covenants 84:85
.
What does it mean to be given “that portion that shall be meted unto every man”?
How can you apply this in your teaching?
What has the Lord promised faithful missionaries about knowing what to say?
Doctrine and Covenants 68:2–3
;
100:5–8
Matthew 10:19–20
Teach with Your Companion in Unity
The Lord said, “Ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two” (
Doctrine and Covenants 42:6
).
He also charges you and your companion to “be one” (
Doctrine and Covenants 38:27
).
Your teaching will be more powerful and interesting if you and your companion work in unity.
Alternate giving brief portions of the lessons.
During companion study, discuss and practice how you will teach so you can be united.
Prepare how you will work together when teaching people online.
Follow the
safeguards for using technology
, outlined in chapter 2.
Image
missionaries teaching man
When your companion is teaching, pray for, listen to, and look at him or her.
Support your companion by offering a second witness to the truths he or she has taught (see
Alma 12:1
).
Follow your impressions when the Spirit prompts you to say something.
Be sincerely interested in the people you teach.
Listen to them.
Maintain eye contact when they or you are speaking.
Carefully observe their responses, and listen for spiritual promptings.
Invite Members to Participate
Invite members to help you teach and support the people you are working with.
This may happen in person or virtually.
During the weekly coordination meeting, counsel with ward leaders about who could help.
When members participate in teaching and fellowshipping, they can add insights and make connections as friends.
They will feel the joy of missionary work.
Invite Members to Help You Teach
Before lessons, plan with members how to work together.
You could use a text message or brief phone call to confirm what you will be teaching, who will pray, who will lead the conversation, and other details.
Members’ primary role in lessons is to offer sincere testimony, share brief personal experiences, and develop a relationship with those being taught.
You might ask members to share how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson.
If they are converts, invite them to share how they decided to join the Church.
When members refer someone, ask them to participate in the teaching.
Members may be more involved in these situations.
Counsel with them about how they would like to participate.
Consider how using technology to teach with members might be appropriate.
Technology allows members to join you without the time commitment that an in-person visit requires.
In the weekly coordination meeting, plan with ward leaders to have a member participate in as many lessons as possible (see
chapter 13
).
Consider asking new members to help you teach.
Personal or Companion Study
Imagine that you have an appointment to teach a lesson to a family in a member’s home.
Discuss how you would involve each of the following members in helping you teach:
A ward missionary who recently returned from a full-time mission
A priest
A new member
The elders quorum or Relief Society president
Invite Members to Give Support
Members can also give valuable support to people between teaching visits.
They can text, read scriptures together, invite people to their homes or to activities, or invite them to sit together at church.
They can answer questions and show what their lives are like as members of the Church.
Their life experience and perspective can help them relate with people in ways that are sometimes very different from how missionaries relate.
Counsel with members about ways you can work together to support people outside of teaching visits.
Teach for Understanding
Teach the gospel of Jesus Christ so people will understand it.
Study the scriptures and the lessons so you can teach clearly from them.
The more clearly you teach, the better the opportunity for the Holy Ghost to testify of truth.
Ask questions to help people think about what you have taught.
Then listen to see if they understand and accept it.
Part of teaching for understanding is to explain words, phrases, and ideas.
You can improve your ability to teach the gospel by:
Understanding the words you use.
Defining words that others may not understand.
Asking people questions like “Would you share with us your understanding of what we just explained?” or “Would you be willing to summarize what we talked about?”
As you teach the doctrine in
chapter 3
, note any words, phrases, and ideas that people might not understand.
Define these by using the resources in the Gospel Library, such as the
Guide to the Scriptures
, the
Bible Dictionary
, and
Gospel Topics
.
Keep your teaching simple and brief.
Keep it focused on the gospel of Jesus Christ, building understanding of basic doctrine and principles.
Help people seek the understanding that comes from the Holy Ghost.
As they gain this understanding, they will come to believe the message of the gospel.

Ask Questions
The Savior asked questions that invited people to think and feel deeply about the truths He taught.
His questions prompted soul searching and commitment.
Good questions are also important in your teaching.
They will help you understand people’s interests, concerns, and questions.
Good questions can invite the Spirit and help people learn.
Ask Inspired Questions
Seek the guidance of the Spirit in asking good questions.
The right questions at the right times can help people learn the gospel and feel the Spirit.
Inspired questions and sincere listening will help people be more comfortable talking openly and sharing their feelings.
This can help them discover a growing testimony.
They will also be more comfortable asking you questions when they do not understand something or have a concern.
The following table shows some principles of asking inspired questions, along with some examples.
Principles and Examples of Inspired Questions

Companion Study
Review your lesson plan from a recent lesson you have taught.
Write one question for each of the major principles outlined in your plan.
Review your questions to see if they are in harmony with the principles in this section.
Next, answer each question as though you were someone being taught.
Share your questions with your companion.
Together, evaluate and improve your questions.
Personal or Companion Study
People you are teaching might encounter the following experiences:
They have a spiritual experience while reading the Book of Mormon.
Coworkers regularly make fun of spiritual things.
Family members are strong members of another church.
Friends believe that “the Mormons” are not Christians.
Think of a question you would ask to learn more about each of these situations.
Write these questions in your study journal.
Discuss with your companion how you might improve the questions you wrote.
Avoid Ineffective or Excessive Questions
Try not to ask questions that:
Have obvious answers.
Might embarrass someone if he or she does not know the answer.
Include more than one idea.
Pertain to doctrine you have not yet taught.
Do not have a clear purpose.
Are excessive.
Are prying or could irritate and offend people.
Following are examples of less-effective questions:
Who was the first prophet? (The person might not know the answer.)
How will keeping our bodies pure help us have the Spirit and show that we are willing to follow a prophet of God? (There is more than one idea.)
Is it important to know about God’s commandments? (This is a yes-no question, and the answer is obvious.)
What is something we can do every day that will help us feel close to God? (This is a vague question looking for a specific answer: pray.)
Who was the next prophet after Noah? (The person might not know the answer, and the question is not important for your message.)
Do you understand what I am saying? (The person might feel like you are talking down to him or her.)
Personal or Companion Study
Consider the needs of someone you are teaching.
Discuss how he or she might answer your questions.
Plan some questions to ask that follow the guidelines in this section.
Discuss how these questions could invite the Spirit and help the person learn the gospel.
Listen
When you listen carefully to others, you understand them better.
When they know that their thoughts and feelings are important to you, they are more likely to be receptive to your teachings, share personal experiences, and make commitments.
As you listen, you will gain insight into how to adapt your teaching to their needs and interests.
You will have a better understanding of which gospel truths would be most beneficial to them.
Especially listen for the whisperings of the Spirit.
When others share their feelings, the Holy Ghost may prompt you with thoughts or ideas.
The Spirit can also help you understand what others are trying to express.

Listen with Genuine Caring
Listening takes effort and genuine caring.
While others talk, make sure you are concentrating on what they are saying.
Avoid the tendency to be planning what you will say.
Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland taught: “More important than speaking is listening.
These people are not lifeless objects disguised as a baptismal statistic. … Ask these friends what matters most to
them
.
What do
they
cherish, and what do
they
hold dear?
And then listen.
If the setting is right you might ask what their fears are, what they yearn for, or what they feel is missing in their lives.
I promise you that
something
in what they say will
always
highlight a truth of the gospel about which you can bear testimony and about which you can then offer more. … If we listen with love, we won’t need to wonder what to say.
It will be given to us—by the Spirit and by our friends” (“
Witnesses unto Me
,”
Ensign
, May 2001, 15).
Observe Unspoken Messages
People also communicate through their body language.
Notice the way they sit, their facial expressions, what they do with their hands, their tone of voice, and where they are looking.
Observing these unspoken messages can help you understand the feelings of those you teach.
Also be aware of your own body language.
Send a message of interest and enthusiasm by listening sincerely.
Allow People Time to Think and Respond
The Savior often asked questions that required time for a person to respond.
When you ask a question, pause to give the person a chance to think and respond.
Do not be afraid of silence.
People often need time to think about and reply to questions or to express what they are feeling.
You might pause after asking a question, after sharing a spiritual experience, or when people are having difficulty expressing themselves.
Be sure to give them time to complete their thoughts before you respond.
Do not interrupt while they are talking.
Respond with Empathy
When a person answers a question, begin your response by expressing empathy if appropriate.
Empathy shows that you genuinely care.
Refrain from jumping to conclusions, immediately offering solutions, or appearing to have all the answers.
Confirm That You Understand What People Say
When seeking to understand what a person is saying, ask to make sure you understand.
For example, you might ask, “So what you are saying is
.
Is that right?” or “If I understand correctly, you are feeling that
.” When you are not sure if you understand, ask the person for clarification.
Navigate Challenging Interactions
You will help people most by teaching them the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Some people may want to do most of the talking.
Sometimes people simply need someone to listen compassionately to their struggles and feelings.
Other people may seek to dominate or argue.
Learn to manage such situations tactfully and with love.
You may be able to adapt your teaching to address something a person shared.
Or you may need to politely say that you would like to discuss their concern at another time.
The Spirit can help you know how to respond in challenging situations.
Help People Feel Comfortable Sharing True Feelings
To avoid embarrassment, some people will answer questions the way they think you want them to answer rather than share their true feelings.
Seek to develop a relationship that allows them to be comfortable sharing their true feelings with you.
Understanding and connecting with people will allow you to help them, meet their interests and needs, and express the Savior’s love to them.
Create a relationship of trust by being honest with them, maintaining an appropriate missionary relationship, and showing respect.
Personal or Companion Study
Reflect on how well you are listening to others.
Write answers in your study journal to the questions below.
Or discuss them with your companion.
A = Never true of me, B = Sometimes true of me, C = Usually true of me, D = Always true of me
When others talk to me, I think of similar experiences I can share instead of listening carefully.
When others tell me about their feelings, I try to put myself in their position to see how I would feel.
When I teach people, I think about what I am going to say or teach next.
I get frustrated when people talk a lot.
I struggle to follow or understand what others are trying to tell me.
My mind often wanders while my companion is teaching.
I get upset if someone is talking to me and others cut in or distract my attention.
I receive spiritual promptings to say or do something, but I ignore them.
Help People Find Answers to Their Questions and Concerns
Make an earnest effort to address people’s questions and help them resolve their concerns.
However, it is not your responsibility to answer every question.
Ultimately, people must resolve their questions and concerns for themselves.
Realize that not all questions and concerns can be completely answered.
Some answers become clearer with time.
Others have not yet been revealed.
Focus on building a firm foundation of the basic, essential truths of the gospel.
This foundation will help you and those you teach press forward with patience and faith when there are unanswered or difficult questions.
Some principles for answering questions are outlined in this section.

Understand the Concern
Some of what you teach people might seem difficult or unfamiliar to them.
If people have questions or concerns, first seek to understand them clearly.
Sometimes people’s concerns are like an iceberg.
Only a small part is visible above the surface.
These concerns can be complex.
Pray for the gift of discernment, and follow the Spirit in how you respond.
Heavenly Father knows the hearts and experiences of all people (the complete iceberg).
He will help you know what is best for each person.
Often concerns are more social than doctrinal.
For example, some people might fear opposition from family members if they join the Church.
Or they might fear rejection from their friends at work.
Seek to understand the source of the concern by asking questions and listening.
Did the concern arise because the person does not have a spiritual confirmation of the truth of the Restoration?
Did it arise because the person does not want to commit to living a gospel principle?
Knowing the root of their concern will help you know whether to focus on testimony or commitment.
Use the Scriptures, Especially the Book of Mormon, to Help Answer Questions
Show people how the truths in the scriptures can help answer their questions and address their concerns. (See “
The Book of Mormon Addresses Questions of the Soul
” in chapter 5.) When people seek inspiration by studying and applying the scriptures, they will increase their capacity to hear and follow the Lord.
Their faith in Him will increase.
With increased faith will come testimony, repentance, and the ordinance of baptism.

President Henry B.
Eyring
“Sometimes I go to the scriptures for doctrine.
Sometimes I go to the scriptures for instruction.
I go with a question, and the question usually is ‘What would God have me do?’ or ‘What would He have me feel?’ Invariably I find new ideas, thoughts I have never had before, and I receive inspiration and instruction and answers to my questions” (Henry B.
Eyring, in “
A Discussion on Scripture Study
,”
Ensign
, July 2005, 22).
It can be helpful to explain that much of our understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ comes from what has been revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith and those who succeeded him.
Questions about the truthfulness of the gospel can be resolved by gaining a testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.
Reading and praying about the Book of Mormon is a vital way to gain this testimony.
Help people focus on strengthening their faith in Jesus Christ.
Reading and praying about the Book of Mormon is an important way to strengthen their faith.
Invite People to Act in Faith
As people develop and strengthen their testimony of the restored gospel, they will be able to address their questions and concerns from a foundation of faith.
As they act in faith on the truths they believe, they will be able to gain testimonies of other gospel truths.
Some ways to act in faith include:
Praying often and with real intent for inspiration and guidance.
Studying the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon.
Attending church.
Use Reliable Sources
Encourage people to use reliable sources if they have questions.
Explain that not all sources are trustworthy, particularly on the internet.
Many sources use information in misleading ways.
The best sources for learning about the Church are Church-approved resources.
Companion Study
Choose one invitation to extend when you teach a lesson.
Then identify concerns that might keep someone from accepting the invitation or keeping the commitment.
Discuss and practice how you can help people work to resolve their concerns.
Personal or Companion Study
In your study journal, write how you would refer to Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon to respond to the following concerns:
“I don’t believe that God speaks to people anymore.”
“I believe that I can worship God in my own way rather than through an organized religion.”
“Why should I give up drinking wine with my meals if I join your church?”
“Why do I need religion?”
Leave Something to Study and Pray About
At the end of each teaching visit, give people something to study, ponder, and pray about to prepare for the next meeting.
Reading, praying, and pondering between teaching visits invites the influence of the Holy Ghost into their lives.
You might invite people to read specific chapters in the Book of Mormon.
Or you might encourage them to use Church resources, such as Gospel Library, to find answers to questions, learn about a topic, or watch a video.
This can become an opening topic of discussion the next time you meet.
Image
person studying scriptures
Avoid giving people too much to do, especially if you have short, frequent teaching interactions with them.
Personal or Companion Study
Consider each person you are scheduled to teach this week.
What chapters in the Book of Mormon will be most helpful to them?
What other resources would benefit them?
Record what you intend to provide for each person.
Also record what you will do to follow up during your next visit.
Helping People with Addictions
You can help people who are struggling to overcome addiction by lovingly discussing their struggles, supporting them, and connecting them with resources.
You might encourage them to attend one of the Church’s addiction recovery support groups.
These groups may meet in person or online. (See
AddictionRecovery.ChurchofJesusChrist.org
.) Encourage them to use the resources in the “
Addiction
” section of Life Help in the Gospel Library.
Local Church leaders and members can also provide support.
Some people with addictions may need professional medical and mental health treatment.
Here are a few suggestions for how you can support people struggling to overcome addiction:
Reinforce their efforts to come unto Christ.
Help them see that their efforts to recover and heal are recognized and valued by Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
Teach them that they can be strengthened through the Savior and His Atonement.
He fully recognizes the intent of their heart to do good.
Pray for them in your personal prayers, and pray with them.
As appropriate, encourage them to seek a priesthood blessing from local priesthood leaders.
Continue teaching them the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Teach them that Heavenly Father, the Savior, and the Holy Ghost love them and want their success.
Encourage them to attend church regularly and develop friendships with members.
Be positive and supportive, especially if they relapse.
Image
Jesus reaching out to woman
Addiction is difficult to overcome, and relapses can happen.
Church leaders and members should not be shocked by this.
They should show love, not judgment.
A new member who stops attending church may have returned to an old addiction and may be feeling unworthy and discouraged.
An immediate visit giving encouragement and support can help.
Members should show in word and action that the Church is a place where the love of Christ can be found (see
3 Nephi 18:32
).
Personal or Companion Study
Think of someone you are teaching or a new or returning member who is trying to overcome an addiction.
Review “
Faith in Jesus Christ
” and “
Repentance
” from “The Gospel of Jesus Christ” lesson in chapter 3.
What could you teach this person from that lesson and from this chapter that could help him or her?
Create a lesson plan to help this person.
Teaching People Who Do Not Have a Christian Background
Some of the people you teach may not have a Christian background or may not believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
However, many of these people have beliefs, practices, and places they hold sacred.
It is essential that you show respect for their religious beliefs and traditions.
Help Them Understand Who God Is
You may wonder how you should adjust your teaching for people who do not have a Christian background.
The principles that help a person build faith are the same in all cultures.
Help people gain a correct understanding of God and the divine mission of Jesus Christ.
The best way for them to learn these truths is by having personal spiritual experiences.
Some ways you can help them have these experiences are outlined below:
Teach that God is our Heavenly Father, and He loves us.
We are His children.
Invite them to seek that witness for themselves.
Teach about the plan of salvation.
Teach that God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith.
Bear sincere testimony of the gospel, including how you feel Heavenly Father’s love and why you choose to follow Jesus Christ.
Invite them to offer simple, heartfelt prayers—with you and on their own.
Invite them to read the Book of Mormon daily—with you and on their own.
Invite them to attend church.
Introduce them to members of the Church who can explain how they came to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
Invite them to keep the commandments.
Most people desire to have a greater connection with God and to find purpose and meaning in life.
Help them see how they are children of a loving Father in Heaven and how He has a plan for them.
For example, you might begin by saying something like the following:
God is our Father in Heaven, and He loves us.
We are His children.
We lived with Him before we were born.
Because we are all His children, we are all brothers and sisters.
He desires us to return to Him.
Because of His love for us, He has provided a way for us to return to Him through His Son, Jesus Christ.
Adapt Your Teaching as Needed
Many converts from non-Christian backgrounds say that they did not understand much of what the missionaries were teaching.
However, they felt the Spirit and wanted to do what the missionaries asked.
Do all you can to help people understand the doctrine of the gospel.
Be patient and supportive.
It may take time for people to learn to identify and express their feelings.
You may need to adjust the pace and depth of your teaching to help them.
The following suggestions may help as you prepare to teach people who do not have a Christian background:
Understand what spiritual need or interest prompts them to meet with you.
Provide simple overviews and reviews for each lesson.
Ask them to tell you what they understand and what they have experienced.
Define essential words and principles.
People may not be familiar with many of the words you use as you teach.
Return to a previously taught lesson to teach the doctrine more clearly.
This may be necessary any time during the teaching process.
Identify invitations that you could extend to help people experience the blessings of the gospel.
Listed below are some resources in Gospel Library that you might use to help those without a Christian background:

”
Personal or Companion Study
If possible, identify a convert who did not have a Christian background before meeting with the missionaries.
Arrange to meet and ask about his or her conversion experience.
For example, you might ask the person about:
What led him or her to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
What the experience of praying for the first time was like.
What it was like the first time he or she felt an answer to prayer.
The role of the scriptures in his or her conversion.
What it was like to attend church.
Write what you learn in your study journal.
Consider inviting the person to help you teach someone who does not have a Christian background.
Remember This
All people will benefit as they accept and live the restored gospel.
Plan and study each day with your companion to be united and to teach with one voice.
Share your testimony often.
The scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, are your basic sources for teaching.
Pray for help in using what you have learned in this chapter.
Ideas for Study and Application
Personal Study
Assume you are placed in the following situations.
How might you use the principles and skills in this chapter to help these people progress?
Plan how you would apply them in each situation.
Someone who has been preparing for baptism tells you that he or she no longer wants to meet with you.
You are meeting for the seventh time with a person who has been taught by several missionaries over a two-year period.
There have been few if any signs of progress.
Select one of the missionary lessons.
Identify one or two scripture passages from each main principle.
Practice teaching from those passages as outlined in the “
Use the Scriptures
” section of this chapter.
Companion Study and Companion Exchange
Read the account of Ammon and King Lamoni in
Alma 18–19
and the account of Aaron in
Alma 22:4–18
.
As you read, identify and describe how Ammon and Aaron:
Followed the Spirit and taught with love.
Began to teach.
Adapted their teaching to meet needs.
Bore testimony.
Used the scriptures.
Asked questions, listened, and helped those they taught to resolve their concerns.
Encouraged those they taught to make commitments.
Discuss how their service and teaching impacted King Lamoni, his father, and Abish.
District Council, Zone Conferences, and Mission Leadership Council
Invite members or those currently being taught to your meeting.
Explain to the group that you want missionaries to improve their ability to share their important message.
Select a lesson and a skill.
Have the missionaries teach the person or people the lesson you have selected for 20 minutes, focusing on the skill you have identified.
Have them switch who they teach after 20 minutes.
After the missionaries have taught, bring the group together.
Have the person or people tell the missionaries what was most effective and one way they can improve.
Show video examples of missionaries teaching or contacting people.
Select a skill and discuss how well the missionaries applied the principles for that skill.
Select a skill, and identify doctrine or scripture passages that support it.
Teach the doctrinal foundation of the skill to the missionaries.
Mission Leaders and Mission Counselors
Occasionally accompany missionaries as they teach.
Plan how you can participate in the teaching.
Encourage local leaders to participate with missionaries in their teaching visits.
Demonstrate and help missionaries practice one of the teaching skills described in this chapter, such as asking good questions and listening.
Demonstrate the effective use of scriptures when teaching missionaries in zone conferences, mission leadership council, and interviews.
Do the same when you teach with them.
Help missionaries understand the scriptures and develop a love for them.
Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland counseled mission leaders:
“Make a love for the word of God absolutely central to your mission culture. … Make familiarity with the revelations and regular use of the standard works one of the chief characteristics of your missionaries for the rest of their lives.
“When you teach your missionaries—and that is all the time—teach them from the scriptures.
Let them see where you get your strength and inspiration.
Teach them to love and depend on those accumulated revelations.
“[My] mission president taught from the Book of Mormon and [other] scriptures every time we were in his presence, or so it seemed.
Personal interviews were laced with scripture.
Outlines for … meetings were drawn from the standard works. …
“We didn’t know it at the time, but our president was arming us on the right hand and on the left, exhorting us with all the energy of his soul and with all the faculty he possessed to hold fast to the iron rod in order that we would never perish [see
1 Nephi 15:23–25
]” (“The Power of the Scriptures” seminar for new mission leaders, June 25, 2022).

Chapter 11
Help People Make and Keep Commitments
Consider This
How does keeping commitments relate to conversion?
How does keeping commitments relate to keeping covenants?
How can I extend invitations to help people grow spiritually and strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ?
Why is it important to share a sincere testimony?
What blessings can I promise?
How can I help people keep commitments?
Repentance, Commitment, and Conversion
As a missionary and disciple of Jesus Christ, you desire the salvation of souls (see
Mosiah 28:3
).
The Savior is “mighty to save” those who keep the covenants they make through receiving essential priesthood ordinances, beginning with baptism (see
2 Nephi 31:19
).
Extending invitations and helping people keep commitments will prepare them for baptism.
People are saved on condition of repentance (see
Helaman 5:11
).
Repentance is a full and sincere turning to Jesus Christ.
Commitment is an essential part of repentance.
When you invite people to make commitments as part of your teaching, you are inviting them to repent.
Commitment means choosing a course of action and following through on that choice.
Consistently acting on truths of the gospel leads to conversion.
Conversion is a change in a person’s beliefs, heart, and life to accept and follow God’s will.
It is a conscious decision to become a disciple of Christ.
Conversion occurs as people exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, are baptized, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end.
The Lord and His prophets refer to this change as a spiritual rebirth (see
John 3:3–5
;
Mosiah 27:25–26
).
The Savior’s Atonement makes conversion possible, and the Holy Ghost brings about this mighty change of heart (see
Mosiah 5:2
;
Alma 5:12–14
).
Conversion is a process, not an event.
Helping people become converted to Jesus Christ is central to your missionary purpose.
As guided by the Spirit, you invite people to make commitments that will help them grow spiritually and feel the influence of the Holy Ghost in their lives.
Then you support people in keeping the commitments they have made.
You help them act in faith toward lasting change (see
Mosiah 6:3
).
People who keep commitments before baptism are more likely to make and keep sacred covenants afterward.
When you teach people to keep commitments, you are teaching them to keep covenants.
Making and keeping covenants is an essential part of the gospel of Jesus Christ and God’s plan for His children.
This chapter includes guidelines for extending invitations, promising blessings, sharing your testimony, and helping people keep their commitments so they can come unto the Savior and be saved.

Extend Invitations
As a representative of Jesus Christ, you invite people to follow Him and receive the joy of His gospel.
You extend specific invitations for them to do things that will build their faith in Christ.
Then you support them in keeping their commitments.
Invitations and commitments are vital for the following reasons:
They help people live the principles they learn so they feel the confirming witness of the Spirit.
Keeping commitments is one way people demonstrate repentance (see
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
).
Repentance helps people experience the peace and joy of God’s forgiveness.
They will also have increased help from God for their challenges.
Keeping commitments prepares people to make and keep sacred covenants.
You can show your love for people and your faith in God’s promises by helping people keep their commitments.
Invite as Led by the Spirit
Seek the guidance of the Spirit about what invitations to extend and when to extend them.
Consider what teaching or doctrine, correctly understood, will help a person accept your invitation.
The right invitation at the right time can prompt people to do things that will build their faith.
These actions can lead to a mighty change of heart (see
Mosiah 5:2
;
Alma 5:12–14
).
The invitations you extend may be small, such as reading a chapter of scripture or coming to sacrament meeting.
Or they may be as pivotal as being baptized.
Invitations should be appropriate for where a person is on his or her spiritual journey.
Spirit-led invitations build on each other to help a person progress spiritually (see
2 Nephi 28:30
;
Doctrine and Covenants 93:12–13
).
Ask yourself, “What commitments is the person keeping?
What does he or she need to do next to progress?”
Listen to those you are talking with or teaching.
From what you hear and feel, seek the Spirit’s guidance about what invitations will help each person progress toward making sacred covenants.
Principles for Extending Invitations
Extending invitations requires faith in Christ.
Have faith that He will bless people when they accept and follow through on your invitations.
People are more likely to change when you invite them to act on a truth of the gospel and help them see how the change will bless them.
They will change to the degree that they feel the Spirit and experience the joy of living the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Whenever you engage with people, in person or online, consider what invitation could help them strengthen their faith in Christ and feel the Spirit.
Sometimes this may be as simple as meeting with you again or coming to a Church activity.
As you prepare to teach a lesson, consider the needs and progress of each person.
Make sure your lesson plan includes one or more invitations that will help the person progress.
Be careful not to extend too many invitations at once.
A person needs time to act, grow, and learn from each invitation.
Be bold but not overbearing as you invite people to make commitments (see
Alma 38:12
).
Respect people’s agency.
Scripture Study
Why are commitments important?

Invite with Kind and Clear Language
An invitation often takes the form of a “will you” question, which requires a yes or no response.
Make your invitations kind, specific, and clear.
They should invite or lead people to make a commitment to act with faith in Jesus Christ.
Although your invitations will be unique for each person, consider the following examples:
Attending church provides a time and place for you to worship God and feel His Spirit.
It can also help you become part of a supportive community as you make changes to come closer to the Savior.
Will you come with us to sacrament meeting this Sunday?
Now that we have discussed the importance of studying the scriptures, will you read [a specific passage of scripture]?
Will you write down any impressions or questions you may have?
We can discuss your thoughts the next time we meet.
We have been discussing the life of the Savior and His commandments.
Will you follow His example by being baptized into His Church and making promises with Him? (See “
The Invitation to Be Baptized and Confirmed
” in chapter 3.)
You expressed interest in connecting more with God in your life.
Will you pray with faith during the next few days so you can experience the blessings of prayer?
We have a video that we think you will find helpful.
Can we show it to you or send you a link?
Will you watch it?
Can we check with you tomorrow to see what you think?
Seek the promptings of the Holy Ghost as you consider natural ways to extend kind, specific, and clear invitations.
Personal or Companion Study
In your study journal, write an invitation that is simple, direct, and clear for each commitment in a lesson.
If you have done this activity before, repeat it and compare your new invitations with previous ones.
Review the invitations you have written with your companion.
Then discuss the following questions:
How can we help people understand the Lord’s promised blessings associated with this invitation?
Why is this invitation important to me personally?
How can I help people feel God’s love for them as I extend invitations?
How can I improve in helping others act on invitations I extend?
Think of someone you are teaching.
Practice extending these invitations as though you were addressing that person.
Revise your invitations as needed.
Promise People Blessings
God promises to bless us as we keep His commandments (see
Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21
).
People who keep the commandments and remain faithful “are blessed in all things” and will “dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness” (
Mosiah 2:41
).
As you invite people to make commitments, promise them blessings for keeping their commitments.
You can identify many of these blessings by studying the scriptures, the teachings of latter-day prophets, and the lessons in
chapter 3
.
Think also of the blessings in your own life.
Prayerfully decide what blessings to promise each person as you extend invitations.
When inviting a person to live a commandment, teach the following:
Obeying the commandments shows our love for Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ (see
John 14:15
).
Obeying the commandments shows God that we trust Him (see
Proverbs 3:5–6
).
God’s blessings are both spiritual and temporal (see
Mosiah 2:41
).
God’s greatest blessing is eternal life (see
Doctrine and Covenants 14:7
).
As we sincerely pray and act in faith, God will help us accomplish the things He has commanded us to do (see
1 Nephi 3:7
).
God fulfills His promises to bless us according to His way and timing (see
Doctrine and Covenants 88:68
).
People often face opposition in keeping the commandments.
Support those you teach, and assure them that God will bless them as they strive to do His will.
Help them understand that opposition is an opportunity to grow by choosing to follow Christ even when it is difficult (see
2 Nephi 2:11, 13–16
).
Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland taught: “Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ,
they come
” (“
An High Priest of Good Things to Come
,”
Ensign
, Nov.
1999, 38).
Scripture Study
What do the following scriptures teach about the Lord’s desire to bless us?
Alma 37:17
Doctrine and Covenants 1:37
;
76:5–10
Personal Study
Read
Doctrine and Covenants 82:10
and
130:20–21
.
Then study the following scriptures.
Make two columns in your study journal.
On one side, write the commandment you find in each passage.
On the other side, write the promise for keeping the commandment.
Doctrine and Covenants 11:21
;
50:5
;
84:85
;
89:18–21
;
95:8–9
;
100:5–8
Malachi 3:10–12
Share Your Testimony
Share your testimony whenever you extend an invitation and promise blessings.
Tell how you have been blessed as you have lived the principle you are teaching.
Share your testimony that the principle will bless the person’s life as he or she lives it.
Your sincere testimony will help create an environment for people to feel the Holy Ghost confirm truth.
This will encourage them to accept the invitations you will extend.
For more information, see “
Share Your Testimony
” in chapter 10.

Help People Keep Their Commitments
When people accept your invitations to do something, follow up to help them keep their commitments.
You are helping people develop faith in Christ.
Your role is to help them strengthen their faith and their resolve to progress toward full conversion.
Do not just invite people to change; support them in doing it.
People will receive a witness of the Spirit as they exercise faith unto repentance by keeping commitments.
That witness often does not come “until after the trial of [their] faith” (
Ether 12:6
).
Do not be surprised when opposition arises.
Plan how you will help them through the trial so they receive the witness of the Spirit.
Other members of the Church can also provide support.
People often feel the influence of the Spirit when you are with them.
Emphasize the importance of praying, reading the scriptures, and following through on your invitations so they will have these feelings when they are on their own.
Keeping commitments prepares people for ordinances and covenants along the path of lifelong conversion.
Your efforts can help them “manifest by their works” their desire to follow Jesus Christ (
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
).

Plan for Brief Daily Contact
Helping people keep commitments begins when you first visit and teach them.
Ask them to record their commitment on their phone, calendar, or something you leave with them.
Ask if you, or a member who has been participating, can make a brief daily contact between teaching visits.
Explain that the purpose of these contacts is to support them, and describe some ways you can do that.
These contacts are one way to apply the principle in
Doctrine and Covenants 84:106
.
Determine the method of contact that would be most effective, such as a brief visit, phone call, text, or social media message.
Technology offers many options for additional reminders and support.
Encourage and Help People in Your Daily Contact
For every invitation you extend, record notes in the Preach My Gospel app about how to follow up the next day.
As you plan the next day, seek the guidance of the Spirit as you discuss how to help people keep their commitments.
Make your daily contacts with people positive and encouraging.
Pray for them.
Show love and understanding as you help them keep their commitments.
Answer questions and help them overcome challenges.
If there is time, read together from the Book of Mormon.
Share relevant Church media, including music produced by the Church that might lift them.
Be respectful of their time and wishes.
Introduce them to other Church members.
When appropriate, ask members to help people keep their commitments (see
chapter 10
).
Compliment people who are working to keep their commitments.
Help them see how the Lord is pleased with their efforts.
These people are changing their lives, which takes a lot of work and patience.
Help them recognize the blessings they are receiving.
Express confidence that they can succeed.
Also show love if people have not kept their commitments.
Offer to support them during your daily contact.
For example, if someone accepted an invitation to read a chapter in the Book of Mormon but has not done it yet, offer to read it together.
Help the person discover by experience how keeping commitments can bless his or her life.
It might take many tries for people to keep a commitment, and you might need to make several visits to help them.
Discuss how they can overcome challenges to keeping commitments.
Be patient and supportive, not critical or judgmental.
Have the Influence of the Holy Ghost in Your Daily Contact
When you follow up with people, ask them to share their experience with keeping commitments.
Ask what they have learned and felt.
This will help them recognize the Spirit’s influence in their lives and help them identify the next step.
As you contact people each day, an important part of your purpose is to invite the influence of the Holy Ghost into their lives.
Help them recognize how to feel the Spirit when you are not present.
Your daily contact should strengthen the spiritual feelings they felt when you taught them.
They will be converted as they feel the power and influence of the Holy Ghost.
Show Love
The process of conversion is centered in Christlike love (see
4 Nephi 1:15
).
Seek the gift of charity.
Showing sincere love can help people feel the Spirit in their lives.
Your expressions of love can also help them accept invitations and keep commitments that lead to conversion.
As you love and teach others, your own conversion to the Savior will deepen.
Assisting with the conversion of another person is a sacred work.
You will find lasting joy as you devote yourself to this work and to serving others (see
Matthew 10:39
;
Mosiah 2:17
;
Alma 27:17–18
;
Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–16
).
Personal or Companion Study
Record in the Preach My Gospel app your plans for daily contact with each person you are teaching.
Plan several days in advance what you will do to follow up with each person.
Choose one invitation you will extend when you teach each person.
Then identify different concerns that might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment.
Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns.
The Lord Desires People to Come and Stay
Missionary work has its greatest effect as people make and keep the commitment to live the gospel and stay active in the Church throughout their lives.
It is not enough for them to simply come into the Church.
The Lord desires that they come to stay (see
John 15:16
).
Direct all your teaching and invitations toward that end.
To receive all the blessings that Heavenly Father has for them, members must continue to live the gospel by keeping the commandments and the covenants they have made as they stay active in the Church.
Nephi taught: “After ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?
Behold, I say unto you, Nay; … ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, … and [if ye] endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (
2 Nephi 31:19–20
).
Give your best efforts to help people qualify for “eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God” (
Doctrine and Covenants 14:7
).
Remember This
Commitment is an essential part of repentance and conversion.
When you invite people to make commitments, you are inviting them to repent.
As people keep commitments, they are preparing to keep covenants with God.
Invite people to make commitments in every finding or teaching situation.
Promise blessings.
Share your testimony.
Help people keep their commitments.
Ideas for Study and Application
Personal Study
Identify a commandment from
lesson 4
.
Find and record the scripture references and quotations from latter-day prophets that describe the promised blessings associated with this commandment.
Think of the blessings you have received by obeying this commandment, and write them in your journal.
When you communicate with your family or others, ask how they have been blessed by obeying a specific commandment (for example, keeping the Sabbath day holy, obeying the law of tithing, or keeping a commandment that is difficult for someone you are teaching).
Answer the following questions to help you identify areas where you can improve when extending invitations.
Make plans to improve.
Do the people know that I love them?
Am I confident that they will be blessed by acting on our invitations?
Do I give appropriate time and attention to making daily contact with people to help them keep their commitments?
Do our lesson plans include specific invitations to act?
Companion Study and Companion Exchange
Review the invitations in one of the missionary lessons.
For each invitation, answer the following questions:
What blessings has the Lord promised to those who keep this commitment?
How will obeying this principle help people increase their faith and testimony?
How will this commitment help people repent and be more sensitive to the Spirit?
From your planning tools, make a list of people you have contacted in the past two days.
Include those you are teaching and members.
For each person, write the invitations you extended and commitments they made.
Consider what other invitations you could have extended.
Discuss why you were able to obtain commitments from some of these people but not from others.
What will you do to follow up on these invitations?
District Council, Zone Conferences, and Mission Leadership Council
Discuss effective and creative ideas for daily contact with people you are teaching.
How have missionaries worked with members effectively?
What printed or digital media are useful?
What can you do when people are not home or are too busy to see you?
Discuss ways that missionaries have effectively taught the commandments in
lesson 4
.
Mission Leaders and Mission Counselors
When possible, accompany missionaries as they teach.
Help them focus on helping people make and keep commitments.
Encourage ward priesthood leaders, organization leaders, and members to make daily contact with people the missionaries are teaching—if the people have agreed to this contact.

Help People Prepare for Baptism and Confirmation
Consider This
How can I help people prepare for baptism and confirmation?
How do I conduct a baptismal interview?
How is an uplifting baptismal service planned and conducted?
Why is it important to complete and submit the Baptism and Confirmation Form?
How can I support new members?
Baptism is a joyous ordinance of hope that brings the power of God into a person’s life.
That power comes through receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.
It will continue as a person endures to the end in keeping the baptismal covenant.
The purpose of your teaching is to help others develop their faith in Jesus Christ, repent of their sins, and be baptized with a sincere desire to follow Christ.
As Mormon taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” (
Moroni 8:25
).
As the people you teach keep the commitments you invite them to make, they will be prepared to make and keep covenants with God and enjoy the promised blessings.
Baptism and confirmation are not a final destination.
Rather, these ordinances are the gate by which God’s children enter the covenant path.
This path leads to the ordinances, covenants, and joyous blessings of the temple—and ultimately to eternal life (see
3 Nephi 11:20–40
).
Qualifications for Baptism and Confirmation
God invites all His children to come unto Him through baptism and confirmation (see
2 Nephi 26:33
;
3 Nephi 27:20
).
The qualifications for baptism are the same for all.
From
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
:
Humble yourself before God.
Desire to be baptized.
Come forth with a broken heart and contrite spirit.
Repent of all your sins and pray for forgiveness.
Be willing to take upon yourself the name of Christ.
Have a determination to serve Christ to the end.
Show by your works that you have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of your sins.
From the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles:
Respond appropriately to the baptismal interview questions.
Receive all the missionary lessons.
Meet the elders quorum president, Relief Society president, and bishop.
Attend several sacrament meetings.
These qualifications are indicators of the spiritual process of conversion.
When people meet these qualifications, they are ready for the sacred ordinances of baptism and confirmation.
When a person has set a firm baptismal date:
Carefully review his or her record in the Preach My Gospel app to ensure that you have taught the necessary doctrine and commandments.
Create a schedule for the events that are needed to prepare for baptism and confirmation.
Review this schedule with the person.
If possible, invite the person to attend a baptismal service before his or her own baptism.
Scripture Study
Study the following scriptures.
How can you help those you teach prepare for baptism and confirmation?
Record what you are learning from your study.

Help People Prepare for Their Baptismal Interview
The baptismal interview is an important step to ensure that a person meets the Lord’s qualifications for baptism.
Schedule a baptismal interview only when a person is ready.
Help people prepare for this interview so they feel comfortable about it.
Explain what it will be like.
Tell them that they will meet with another missionary like you.
Explain the purpose of the interview.
It is an opportunity for them to witness that they have “repented of all their sins [and] manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins” (
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
).
Share the questions the interviewer will ask (see below).
This helps the person prepare to answer them.
Make sure the person understands what you have taught and the covenant he or she will make at baptism.
This covenant is to:
Be willing to take upon him or her the name of Jesus Christ.
Keep the commandments of God.
Serve God and others.
Endure to the end. (See
lesson 4
.)
Bear testimony about the great blessings that come from being baptized and confirmed and keeping the baptismal covenant.
These blessings include the remission of sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Conducting the Baptismal Interview
Each person who desires to be baptized is interviewed by an authorized priesthood leader.
In a mission, this person is the district or zone leader.
He conducts interviews for:
Persons ages 9 and older who have never been baptized and confirmed.
Children ages 8 and older whose parents are not members of the Church.
Children ages 8 and older who have a parent who is also being baptized and confirmed.
Guidelines for the interviewer are provided below.
Hold the interview in a comfortable, private place where the Spirit can be felt.
When interviewing a child, youth, or woman, the interviewer’s companion should be nearby in an adjoining room, foyer, or hall.
If the person desires, another adult may be invited to participate in the interview.
Missionaries should avoid all circumstances that could be misunderstood.
Begin with prayer.
Help the person feel comfortable.
Make the interview a spiritually uplifting experience.
Make sure the person understands the purpose of the interview.
Ask the baptismal interview questions listed below.
Adapt the questions to the person’s age, maturity, and circumstance as needed.
Respond to the person’s questions.
Review the information on the Baptism and Confirmation Form for accuracy.
If the person is a minor, a parent or guardian needs to sign the form before the baptism (see the “
Baptism and Confirmation: Questions and Answers
” section in this chapter).
Invite the person to bear testimony or share his or her feelings.
Express appreciation for being able to meet with the person.
Baptismal Interview Questions
The baptismal interview questions are as follows:
Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father?
Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world?
Do you believe that the Church and gospel of Jesus Christ have been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith?
Do you believe that [current Church President] is a prophet of God?
What does this mean to you?
What does it mean to you to repent?
Do you feel that you have repented of your past sins?
You have been taught that membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints includes living gospel standards.
What do you understand about the following standards?
Are you willing to obey them?
The law of chastity, which prohibits any sexual relations outside the bonds of a legal marriage between a man and a woman
The law of tithing
The Word of Wisdom
Keeping the Sabbath day holy, including partaking of the sacrament weekly and serving others
Have you ever committed a serious crime?
If so, are you now on probation or parole?
Have you ever participated in an abortion? (See
General Handbook
,
38.6.1
.)
When you are baptized, you covenant with God that you are willing to take upon yourself the name of Christ, serve others, stand as a witness of God at all times, and keep His commandments throughout your life.
Are you ready to make this covenant and strive to be faithful to it?
For instructions if the person answers affirmatively to question 5 or 6, see
General Handbook
,
38.2.8.7
and
38.2.8.8
.
Become familiar with the policies and guidelines related to baptism and confirmation in
General Handbook
,
38.2.8
.
Some of these policies involve special circumstances that you may encounter.
After the interview, the missionary and the candidate rejoin the other missionaries.
If the person is ready for baptism, the missionaries explain what will happen at the baptismal service.
They also explain that the confirmation typically takes place in a sacrament meeting of the ward where the person lives.
When a Baptism Needs to Be Postponed
Sometimes a baptism needs to be postponed because of challenges with testimony or worthiness.
When this happens, handle the situation sensitively and privately.
Help the person understand how to prepare for baptism at a future date.
Encourage the person and offer hope in Christ and His Atonement.
Ask ward members to provide fellowship.
Continue teaching the basic principles of the gospel until the person is ready to be baptized and confirmed.
Wait until that time to schedule a new baptismal date.
Baptism and Confirmation: Questions and Answers
Do I need permission to baptize a minor?
The Church is concerned for the well-being of children and the harmony of their home environment.
A minor, as defined by local laws, may be baptized when both of the following conditions are met:
The custodial parent(s) or legal guardian(s) give written permission.
They should have a general understanding of the doctrine their child will be taught as a member of the Church.
They should also be willing to support the child in making and keeping the baptismal covenant.
The person who conducts the interview discerns that the child understands the baptismal covenant.
He should feel confident that the child will strive to keep this covenant by obeying the commandments, including attending Church meetings.
Do I need consent of the spouse to baptize a husband or wife?
Yes.
A married person must have the consent of his or her spouse before being baptized.
If a parent in a family is not ready for baptism, should I baptize other family members or wait until the parent is ready?
It is preferable that family members be baptized together.
However, if some are not ready, individual family members may be baptized as long as any necessary consent is given.
Should baptisms of family members be delayed until the father can receive the Aaronic Priesthood and perform the baptisms himself?
No.
Newly baptized brethren do not receive the Aaronic Priesthood on the day they are baptized.
They first need to be interviewed by the bishop and sustained by ward members.
May I teach and baptize a person who resigned Church membership or whose membership was withdrawn?
People who resigned Church membership or whose membership was withdrawn may be readmitted by baptism and confirmation.
If they would like to be taught, counsel with local priesthood leaders and your mission president about any role you might have.
In a stake, readmission by baptism is under the direction of the bishop or stake president.
In a mission, readmission is under the direction of the mission president.
These leaders will receive guidance from the First Presidency as needed.
Missionaries do not conduct these baptismal interviews or fill out the Baptism and Confirmation Form.
However, a missionary may be invited to perform the baptism.
Former members of the Church who rejoin are not converts.
Nevertheless, missionaries can sometimes have an important role in helping them enjoy the blessings of Church membership again.
What if a person has a scheduled baptismal date but is not keeping all the commitments?
Wait to schedule a baptismal interview until the person is keeping the commitments and meets the baptism qualifications.
See “
When a Baptism Needs to Be Postponed
” in this chapter.
What if a couple want to be baptized but are living together?
A couple living together outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman may not be baptized until they live the law of chastity.
This means no longer living together—whether as a heterosexual couple or a same-sex couple—or, for a man and a woman, it means getting married.
It also includes exercising faith unto repentance as described in
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37
.
Marriage between a man and a woman is an essential part of God’s plan.
Questions 5 and 6 in the baptismal interview ask if a person has ever committed a serious crime or participated in an abortion.
What should I do if someone answers “yes” to either of these questions?
If you become aware of one of these situations during a baptismal interview, do not ask about the details.
Do not promise that the person will be approved for baptism.
Instead, express your love and kindly explain that someone with more maturity and experience will talk with the person and help.
Send a baptismal interview request to your mission president.
He or one of his counselors will meet with the person.
See
General Handbook
,
38.2.8.7
and
38.2.8.8
.
What should I do if a membership record has been created before I submit the Baptism and Confirmation Form?
Contact your mission president for instructions.
Personal Study
Think about how you might feel if you were being interviewed.
Consider the following questions and record your impressions.
How might the interview seem uncomfortable to you?
What could the interviewer do or say to put you at ease?
How would you want the interviewer to interact with you?
How would you want the interviewer to respond if you expressed doubts or misunderstandings or if you confessed serious sins?

The Baptismal Service
The baptismal service and confirmation should be spiritual highlights for a new member.
The baptismal service should be scheduled as soon as a person has met the qualifications for baptism.
Explain what is planned and why.
Discuss proper dress, including how the person will be given white clothing to wear for the baptism.
Baptismal services for converts are planned under the bishopric’s guidance.
The ward mission leader (if one is called) or the member of the elders quorum presidency who leads missionary work plans and conducts these services.
He coordinates with the full-time missionaries.
Baptismal services should be simple, brief, and spiritually uplifting.
Invite a member of the bishopric, a member of the Relief Society presidency, and a member of the elders quorum presidency (if he is not conducting) to attend the baptismal service.
When appropriate, invite other organization leaders, youth leaders, and ministering brothers and sisters (if assigned).
Work with the person being baptized to invite friends and relatives to attend the baptismal service and the confirmation.
Consider inviting other people you are teaching.
These experiences will help them feel the Spirit and learn more about the gospel.
After the service, follow up to discuss their experience and invite them to be taught.
A baptismal service may include the following:
Prelude music
A brief welcome from the priesthood leader who is conducting the service (a member of the bishopric should preside if possible)
An opening hymn and prayer
One or two short messages on gospel subjects, such as baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost
A musical selection
The baptism
A time of reverence while those who participated in the baptism change into dry clothes. (Hymns or Primary songs may be played or sung during this time.
Or the missionaries could give a brief gospel presentation.)
Bearing of testimony by new members, if desired
A closing hymn and prayer
Postlude music
If you schedule a baptism on a Sunday, choose a time that conflicts as little as possible with regular Sunday meetings.
Image
confirmation
Confirmation
A person receives the ordinance of confirmation after he or she has been baptized (see
Doctrine and Covenants 20:41
).
A new convert is considered a member of the Church after the ordinances of baptism and confirmation are both completed and properly recorded.
Confirmations are under the direction of the bishop.
However, he does not conduct a separate interview for confirmation.
Work closely with the bishop and the ward mission leader (if one is called) to make sure that new converts are confirmed.
The confirmation should occur as soon as reasonable after baptism, preferably the next Sunday.
However, the bishop can allow the confirmation to take place at the baptismal service as an exception (see
General Handbook
,
18.8
).
Converts are typically confirmed in a sacrament meeting in the ward where they live.
The bishop typically invites missionary elders serving in the ward to participate in the confirmation.
If a missionary performs the confirmation, he also needs approval from the mission president (see
General Handbook
,
18.8.1
).
At least one member of the bishopric participates.
Complete the Baptism and Confirmation Form
It is vital that a membership record is promptly created after a person is baptized and confirmed.
Concerning such records in his day, Moroni wrote that new members “were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way” (
Moroni 6:4
).
As you teach someone who is preparing to be baptized, begin to fill out the Baptism and Confirmation Form in the Preach My Gospel app.
Explain that this form will be used to create a membership record.
This record will contain important information about the ordinances the person receives.
When Church members move, their membership record is forwarded to their new ward so local leaders and members can support them.
As soon as the new member is baptized and confirmed, update the form with information about each ordinance, including who performed it.
When you have completed the form, record the information in the Preach My Gospel app and submit it to the ward clerk electronically.
As soon as the clerk has received the form, he reviews it and creates a membership record.
After the membership record is created, a clerk prepares a Baptism and Confirmation Certificate.
This certificate is signed by the bishop and given to the person.
The name and sex on the membership record and certificate should match the person’s birth certificate, civil birth registry, or current legal name.

After confirmation, teach the missionary lessons again.
You take the lead in teaching.
However, coordinate with ward leaders so ward missionaries or other members participate.
As you teach, encourage new members to keep all the commitments in the lessons.
In weekly coordination meetings, counsel about how members can support new converts and help them stay actively engaged in the Church.
Plan who will introduce them to quorum or organization leaders.
Coordinate the participation of other members as you teach the lessons again.
Ask to have ministering brothers assigned (and ministering sisters for women).
After a male is confirmed, he is eligible to receive the Aaronic Priesthood if he will be at least 12 years old by the end of the year.
Aaronic Priesthood ordinations are under the direction of the bishop (see
General Handbook
,
38.2.9.1
).
As appropriate, communicate throughout your life with those whom you have taught.
Support them in receiving all the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

“When we come with broken hearts and contrite spirits, we can find voice in Jesus Christ and be encircled in His understanding arms of safety.
Sacred ordinances offer covenant belonging and ‘the power of godliness’ to sanctify inner intent and outward action [
Doctrine and Covenants 84:20
].
With His loving-kindness and long-suffering, His Church becomes our Inn” (Gerrit W.
Gong, “
Room in the Inn
,”
Liahona

Help New Members Participate in the Blessings of the Temple
New members of the appropriate age may receive a temple recommend that allows them to be baptized for their deceased family members (see
General Handbook
,
26.4.2
).
They receive this recommend from the bishop.
Encourage and help new members to obtain a temple recommend as soon as reasonable.
If a temple is nearby, consider extending an invitation for a specific time for new members to perform baptisms for deceased ancestors.
In weekly coordination meetings, plan who will introduce new members to the ward temple and family history leader.
This leader can help them prepare to receive the blessings of the temple by making their own temple covenants.
Remember This
Make sure candidates are qualified for baptism and confirmation.
Help baptismal candidates prepare for the baptismal interview.
Help make baptismal services spiritually uplifting.
Complete and submit the Baptism and Confirmation Form.
Continue to support and teach new members after baptism.

President Henry B.
Eyring explained why gospel standards are important.
Discuss the following counsel.
How can you encourage people to desire to meet these standards?
“The Lord sets His standards so that He can bless us.
Think about those blessings: He promises those who meet the standards the help of the Holy Ghost.
He promises personal peace.
He promises the chance to receive holy ordinances in His house.
And He promises those who endure in living His standards that they will have eternal life. …
“Because we love the people we serve, all of us want to do better in lifting our Heavenly Father’s children to the faithfulness and purity they need to have all the blessings of the Lord. …
“… You begin by holding up the Lord’s standards clearly and without apology.
And the more the world drifts from them and mocks them, the bolder we must be in doing that” (“Standards of Worthiness,”

The person did not tell you that he is on probation for a crime.
The person has not received an answer to prayer that Joseph Smith was a prophet.
The person smoked a cigarette two days ago.
The person is not sure that she has received an answer to her prayers.

Consider This
How can I work with ward leaders and members to establish the Church?
What are the responsibilities of stake and ward leaders in missionary work?
What should happen in the weekly coordination meeting with ward leaders?
How can I support leaders in sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members?
Missionaries work with local leaders and members to find people to teach and lead them to the Savior.
You are united by your love for God and His children.
He will magnify your efforts to the degree that you work in unity with local leaders and members.
Make working with them an important part of your goals and plans.
As you come to know and love local leaders and members, you will see ways you can support them in their callings and missionary efforts.
Offer your gifts and talents in ways that uplift and strengthen them.
This chapter explains how you can work with members in sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members.

Support ward leaders by coming prepared to participate in the weekly coordination meeting.
Before the meeting, take time during companionship study to discuss how you can participate effectively.
Keep your records updated in the Preach My Gospel app so leaders have current information about those you are working with.
Prepare to report on assignments from previous meetings.
Participate in the Weekly Coordination Meeting
Weekly coordination meetings are intended to focus on the needs of individuals.
During the meeting, offer how you can support ward members, including youth, in helping meet individuals’ needs.
A weekly coordination meeting usually covers the following four topics:

Which members could participate in the lessons this coming week?
Who will invite them to participate?
What are the challenges for those being taught?
How can members help?
What are the needs for those with a scheduled baptismal date?
Has the baptism been planned? (See “
The Baptismal Service
” in chapter 12.)
How can we help those who were recently baptized?
Possible discussion items:
Which new members in their first year of membership are attending sacrament meeting?
How can we help any who are not attending?
Which new members have friends in the ward?
How can ministering brothers and sisters help?
How can youth quorums and classes help?
Which new members have an assignment or calling?
How can we help new members begin researching their deceased ancestors so temple ordinances can be performed for them?
Do new members have a temple recommend?
If a temple is nearby, how can we help them go to the temple to perform baptisms for these ancestors?
Which lessons from
chapter 3
still need to be taught again?
How can members participate?

What did you learn that you can apply in the next weekly coordination meeting?
How can you better prepare to discuss needs and plan with ward leaders?
In your next planning session, set goals for how you will improve.
Support the Ward’s Plan for Sharing the Gospel
The ward council creates a simple plan for sharing the gospel (see
General Handbook
,
23.5.6
).
Become familiar with this plan.
In weekly coordination meetings, look for ways to help leaders work toward their goals.
Keep leaders informed about what you are doing to support members in sharing the gospel.
If you are invited to attend a ward council meeting, be prepared to give a brief update on the progress of those you are teaching and any assignments you have received (see
General Handbook
,
29.2.5
).
See this opportunity as a time to build ward leaders’ confidence and trust.

Adjust to the Needs of the Local Area
Each ward or branch has unique needs for you to adapt to.
You may serve in a small branch or a young single adult ward, or you may serve multiple wards.
Some leaders will have more experience and some less.
Some leaders will have more time available than others.
Look for ways to help local leaders.
They might ask you to help support members in their ministering assignments.
They might ask you to encourage new members to invite their friends to attend church.
You can provide valuable insights about missionary work as leaders and members learn ways to share the gospel.
Where the Church is relatively new, branch leaders might ask you to help new members understand how the Lord has organized His Church.
Your work with leaders may be different in different areas, but all these activities are essential to blessing individuals and establishing the Lord’s Church.
Help Members and Leaders to Love, Share, and Invite
Encourage members to share the gospel in normal and natural ways.
The
General Handbook
offers instruction and videos to help members and leaders do this by living the principles of love, share, and invite (see
General Handbook
,
23.1.1
,
23.1.2
, and
23.1.3
).
Keep these principles in mind as you work with leaders.
You will be a blessing to leaders as you support their efforts in this work.
In turn, their example will help members become more involved in sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members.
See “
Unite with Members
” in chapter 9 for ideas about supporting members in their efforts to share the gospel.

Support Local Leaders in Strengthening New Members
When people are baptized and confirmed, they become “fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God” (
Ephesians 2:19
; see also
1 Corinthians 12:12–27
).
Work with local leaders to help new members be “nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, … relying alone upon the merits of Christ” (
Moroni 6:4
).

Elder Ulisses Soares
“New converts come into the Church with enthusiasm for what they have found.
And we must immediately build on that enthusiasm. … Missionaries can help introduce and connect the people they teach and the new converts to the faithful members who will reach out to them, listen to them, guide them, and welcome them to church even before they are baptized. … As we [minister] to those who enter the waters of baptism, we will see many more of God’s children endure to the end and receive eternal life” (Ulisses S.
Soares, “Convert Retention,” mission leadership seminar, June 25, 2018).
Help New Members Attend Sacrament Meeting
You have an important role in helping new members attend church.
Work with leaders to ensure that you or ward members help them attend.
The key indicator showing a new member’s sacrament meeting attendance can help you and ward leaders see when he or she may need extra encouragement.
New members are much more likely to continue attending sacrament meeting and partaking of the sacrament when they have friends in the ward.
Help them feel a sense of belonging, especially during their first year of gospel living. (See
Doctrine and Covenants 84:106, 108
.)
Reteach the Lessons in Chapter 3
Help new members continue to strengthen their faith in the Savior Jesus Christ and His gospel.
The truths and principles of the gospel take deeper root as new members continue to learn by the Spirit.
After confirmation, teach the missionary lessons again.
You take the lead in teaching.
However, coordinate with ward leaders so ward missionaries or other members participate.
Reteaching the lessons in
chapter 3
is an important way to help new members be “nourished by the good word of God” (
Moroni 6:4
).
As you teach, encourage new members to keep all the commitments in the lessons.
Read the scriptures with new members, especially the Book of Mormon, and teach gospel principles.
Help them share the gospel with their friends and family.
Each new member has specific needs, and you can help him or her feel loved and welcomed.
Covenant Path Progress Report and
My Covenant Path
Local leaders have resources for their missionary efforts just like you do.
One of these is the Covenant Path Progress report, found in the Member Tools app or Leader and Clerk Resources.
This report lets local leaders see important experiences a person needs to keep progressing on the covenant path before and after baptism.
My Covenant Path
is a resource to help new members “stay anchored to [their] faith in Jesus Christ and feel at home in the Church” (
My Covenant Path
,
iv
).
It introduces new members to activities and opportunities, such as family history and helping deceased ancestors receive sacred ordinances in the temple.
Encourage local members to guide new members through these experiences.
Give support as requested.

Support Local Leaders in Strengthening Returning Members
Some members choose to stop participating in the Church.
Local leaders and other members strive to build strong relationships with them and reach out to them.
The Savior said:
“Unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them” (
3 Nephi 18:32
).
Local leaders might ask you to help returning members build their faith.
Often these assignments will be with part-member families.
Prayerfully consider how you can invite the Spirit into the homes of returning members as you teach them gospel principles and invite them to act.
Show empathy and compassion for their concerns.
As circumstances allow, teach the gospel to those in the household who have not yet been baptized.
Your love and support can help them deepen their faith in Christ and increase their desire to make and keep covenants.
Coordinate with local leaders when you work with returning members.
These efforts can have a lasting impact on individuals and the local congregation.

How can you support local leaders in their responsibilities?
During weekly coordination meetings, ask ward leaders if there are any returning members in your area they would like you to visit this week.
As you visit them, seek to build their faith in Jesus Christ.
Identify all who have been baptized and confirmed in the last year.
Review the record of one of them and discuss how you can work with leaders in the next weekly coordination meeting to help this person.
Record your ideas and suggestions in the Preach My Gospel app.
Repeat this for all the recent converts in your area.
District Council, Zone Conferences, and Mission Leadership Council
Invite a bishop or other ward leader to talk about strengthening new and returning members.
Ask this person to emphasize how missionaries can help.
Discuss the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son (see
Luke 15
).
Invite missionaries to share what they are learning and how they can apply it in their missionary work.
Mission Leaders and Mission Counselors
Work with local leaders to encourage them to help new members:
Be ordained to a priesthood office (for males of the appropriate age).
Be assigned ministering brothers (and ministering sisters for women).
Receive a temple recommend to be baptized in the temple for their deceased ancestors.
Prepare the name of a deceased ancestor to take to the temple.
Receive an assignment or calling to serve in their ward or branch.
In coordination with the stake president, teach local leaders how to hold effective weekly coordination meetings.
Occasionally follow up with new members to find out how they are doing and how missionaries and members can help.
Invite new members to speak to missionaries and relate their experiences in the Church.
