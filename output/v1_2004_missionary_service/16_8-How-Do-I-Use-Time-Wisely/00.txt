Consider This
How can goals help me be a more effective missionary?
What should be the focus of my goals?
What are my planning tools and resources, and how do I use them?
Why is the area book important?
How do I conduct weekly and daily planning sessions?
How will I know if my goals and plans are helping to further the Lord’s work?
You are assigned to do the Lord’s work in a specific area.
He wants you to watch over your area with love and great care.
Your purpose is to help others come unto Him through faith, repentance, baptism and confirmation, and enduring to the end.
Do all you can to leave your area stronger than you found it.
Meaningful goals and careful planning will help you accomplish what the Lord requires of you.
As you care for the people in your assigned area, you will account to Him and to your mission leaders.
Your missionary call letter states: “As you devote your time and attention to serving the Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs, the Lord will bless you with increased knowledge and testimony of the Restoration and of the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ.” This chapter will help you know how goal setting, planning, and accountability can help many people receive the restored gospel.
