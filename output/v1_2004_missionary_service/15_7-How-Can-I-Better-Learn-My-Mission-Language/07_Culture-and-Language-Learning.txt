Culture and Language Learning
Culture and language are closely related.
Understanding the culture will help explain why language is used the way it is.
Strive to understand the culture of the people so that you can communicate the unique aspects of the message of the Restoration in a way that will be clear to them.
One of the greatest things you can do to gain people’s trust and love is to embrace their culture in appropriate ways.
Many great missionaries have done so (see 1 Corinthians 9:20–23 ).
Seek to have the people feel comfortable with you and your language.
Activity: Personal or Companion Study
Imagine that you are serving a mission in Asia.
You are preparing to teach someone about resurrection, and you know that Buddhists believe in reincarnation.
How will you teach about resurrection in such a way that the person will understand that this doctrine is distinctly different from reincarnation?
What words and phrases might you need to learn to accomplish this task?
Think about the cultural and religious background of the people you teach.
Identify an aspect of their background that might lead them to misunderstand the doctrine of the gospel.
Plan ways to teach this doctrine clearly.
