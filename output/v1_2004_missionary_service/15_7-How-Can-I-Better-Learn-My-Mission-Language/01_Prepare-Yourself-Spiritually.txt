Prepare Yourself Spiritually
The Lord declared, “Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power” ( Doctrine and Covenants 90:11 ).
Strengthen your personal testimony to bring converting power to your words.
First study the doctrine and the lessons in your native language.
That understanding will strengthen your testimony and your capacity to teach and testify convincingly.
You can then learn to express the message of the Restoration in your mission language under the guidance of the Spirit.
Listed below are ways you can strengthen your faith that the Lord will help you teach and testify in your mission language:
Recognize that you have been called of God by a prophet.
Live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost.
Be obedient to the commandments and to missionary standards.
Pray sincerely for divine assistance.
Seek the gifts of the Spirit, including the gift of tongues and the gift of interpretation of tongues.
Study, practice, and use the mission language each day.
