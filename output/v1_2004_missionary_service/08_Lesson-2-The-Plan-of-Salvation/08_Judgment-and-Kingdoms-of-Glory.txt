Judgment and Kingdoms of Glory
During our mortal lives we make choices regarding good and evil.
God rewards us according to our works and desires.
Because God rewards everyone according to their desires and their deeds done on earth, there are different kingdoms of glory to which we may be assigned after the Judgment.
Celestial Kingdom
Those who have repented of their sins, received the ordinances of the gospel, and kept the associated covenants will be cleansed by the Atonement of Christ.
They will be saved in the celestial kingdom (see Doctrine and Covenants 137:10 ).
In the scriptures this kingdom is compared to the glory or brightness of the sun.
The celestial kingdom has three heavens or degrees (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1 ), and only those who have an eternal marriage, sealed by the Holy Spirit, can enter into the highest, which is exaltation (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:2 ).
They will live in God’s presence, become like Him, and receive a fulness of joy.
Those in the celestial kingdom who do not have an eternal marriage can enter into another “heaven” or “degree” in the celestial kingdom, but in that place they are ministering angels who “remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, … angels of God forever and ever” ( Doctrine and Covenants 132:17 ; see also Doctrine and Covenants 131:4 ; Russell M.
Nelson, “ Celestial Marriage ,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov.
2008, 92).
Terrestrial Kingdom
People who do not accept the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ in this life or in the world to come but live honorable lives will receive a place in the terrestrial kingdom.
This kingdom is compared to the glory of the moon (see Doctrine and Covenants 76:71–80 ).
Telestial Kingdom
Those who continued in their sins and did not repent in this life or accept the gospel in the world to come will receive their reward in the lowest kingdom, which is called the telestial kingdom.
This kingdom is compared to the glory of the stars (see Doctrine and Covenants 76:81–86 ).

Scripture Study, Church Attendance, and Prayer
Scripture study, church attendance, and prayer can help people feel God’s love and recognize truth through the witness of the Holy Ghost.
Encourage those you teach to include these practices as they learn about the plan of salvation and the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
(See the “ Pray Often ” section in Lesson 4 for guidance on how you might help someone learn how to pray and read the scriptures.) When they consistently study the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon; attend church regularly; and pray to God with faith, sincerity, and real intent (with a commitment to act upon the answers received), God will answer their prayers, guide their lives, and help them discern truth.

Invitation to Be Baptized
As directed by the Spirit, the invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?
We will be holding a baptismal service on [date].
Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?”
