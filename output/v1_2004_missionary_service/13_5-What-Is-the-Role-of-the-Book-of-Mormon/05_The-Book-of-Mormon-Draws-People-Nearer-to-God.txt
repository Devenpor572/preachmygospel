The Book of Mormon Draws People Nearer to God
Regarding the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” ( introduction to the Book of Mormon ).
The Book of Mormon is a springboard to testimony and personal revelation.
Use the Book of Mormon to help people have spiritual experiences, especially a witness from the Holy Ghost that the book itself is true.
By consistently inviting people to live the principles found in the Book of Mormon, you help them develop faith in Jesus Christ and draw nearer to God.
President Gordon B.
Hinckley declared: “Those who have read [the Book of Mormon] prayerfully, be they rich or poor, learned or unlearned, have grown under its power.
… Without reservation I promise you that if you will prayerfully read the Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read it, there will come into your hearts … the Spirit of the Lord.
There will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“ The Power of the Book of Mormon ,” Ensign, June 1988, 6).
