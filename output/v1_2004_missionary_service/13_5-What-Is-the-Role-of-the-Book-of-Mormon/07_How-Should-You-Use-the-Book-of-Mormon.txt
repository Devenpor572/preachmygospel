How Should You Use the Book of Mormon?
Many people you teach either do not read the Book of Mormon or do not understand what they read.
Those who do not read or understand the Book of Mormon will have difficulty receiving a witness that it is true.
Read the Book of Mormon with People You Teach
As you read together, pray that the Holy Ghost will testify to them that the Book of Mormon is true.

You can help people by reading the Book of Mormon with them.
Pray for help as you select passages that address their concerns and problems.
You may read with them as part of a teaching appointment or during a follow-up visit.
You can also arrange for members to read with them.
Some particularly important passages include the title page , the introduction (especially the last two paragraphs), and Moroni 10:3–5 .
These passages help people understand how to gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon.
Encourage them to read the Book of Mormon from the beginning, including the testimonies of the Three and Eight Witnesses and the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith .
Read and discuss short passages (such as 1 Nephi 3:7 or Mosiah 2:17 ) and longer passages or complete chapters (such as 2 Nephi 31 , Alma 7 , or 3 Nephi 18 ).
“Please do not take the Book of Mormon for granted.
Pray for a vision of how the Book of Mormon can be used more effectively in your mission.
I promise that as you do so, your mind will be enlightened with the direction that you should take.”

When you read with people, stop occasionally and discuss what you read.
Point out key messages or important doctrine to look for as you read with them.
Share appropriate insights, feelings, testimonies, and personal experiences.
Help others feel the spiritual power of the Book of Mormon.
In this way you can teach them true doctrine directly from the Book of Mormon.
Continue this practice in subsequent visits so that the people you teach can develop the ability to read and pray on their own.
Teach doctrine and principles using the words and phrases of Book of Mormon prophets.
Explain the background and context of a passage.
Explain unfamiliar words and phrases.
“Liken” what you have read to yourself and those you teach by finding applications that are relevant to you personally (see 1 Nephi 19:23 ).
To “liken” is to create a mental bridge between understanding the doctrine and living the doctrine.
To read sincerely, with real intent, you and those you teach must be willing to act on the doctrine, to incorporate it into your daily lives, and, as necessary, to repent.
By living the doctrine, you will gain an assurance that it is true.
For example, you might say to a person:
“Nephi, like you, was faced with a difficult challenge.
But as he exercised faith to ‘go and do’ what the Lord commanded him, he was able to succeed.
(Read 1 Nephi 3:7 .) I know that God will prepare a way for you to live the Word of Wisdom.”
“John, it is good that you want to be free from the guilt you feel.
Just as the Savior promised the Nephites, if you repent, are baptized, and receive the Holy Ghost, you will be ‘guiltless before [the] Father.’” (Read 3 Nephi 27:16 .)
Rely on the promise in Moroni 10:3–5 .
Every person who sincerely reads and prays about this book can know with certainty of its truthfulness by the power of the Holy Ghost.
Do all you can to help people:
Read the Book of Mormon and ponder its message concerning Jesus Christ.
Pray to God with faith in Jesus Christ to receive a testimony that the Book of Mormon is true and that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration.
Pray sincerely and have real intent, which means that they intend to act on the answer they receive from God.
You too should apply this promise regularly to strengthen and renew your own testimony of the Book of Mormon.
This renewed testimony will help you maintain a firm confidence that anyone who applies this promise will receive the answer.
