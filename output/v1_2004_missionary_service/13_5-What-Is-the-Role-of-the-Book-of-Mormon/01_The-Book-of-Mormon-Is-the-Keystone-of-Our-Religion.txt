The Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” ( introduction to the Book of Mormon ).
On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion?
We have none” (Minutes and Discourse, 21 April 1834, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).
An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge-shaped pieces that lean against each other.
The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and locks the other stones in place.
When Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of Mormon holds our religion together.
President Ezra Taft Benson said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways:
Witness of Christ.
“The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do.
It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.”
Fulness of doctrine.
“The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:9 [; 27:5 ].) … In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of [the doctrine] required for our salvation.
And [it is] taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.”
Foundation of testimony.
“Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.
The enemies of the Church understand this clearly.
This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it.
So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church.
But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it” ( A Witness and a Warning [1988], 18–19).
The Book of Mormon is the most correct of any book on the earth (see introduction to the Book of Mormon ).
It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach people.
Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel.
The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach to people.
