Use the Book of Mormon to Respond to Objections
Many people will not believe everything you teach.
President Ezra Taft Benson taught how the Book of Mormon can be the central resource in responding to such situations:
“We are to use the Book of Mormon in handling objections to the Church.
…
“… All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation.

“… The only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether the Book of Mormon is true.
For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation.
“Our main task is to declare the gospel and do it effectively.
We are not obligated to answer every objection.
Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he must make his stand” ( A Witness and a Warning, 4–5).
For example, sincere people might object to what you have taught about the Word of Wisdom.
Help them see that their real question is whether Joseph Smith was speaking as God’s prophet when this commandment was renewed in this dispensation.
You might say: “Having the faith to accept this teaching will require the assurance that this commandment came to us through revelation from God to the Prophet Joseph Smith.
The way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon.”
People must resolve for themselves their concerns and objections.
You can help as you focus them on what will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ—reading and praying about the Book of Mormon.
When they strengthen their testimony of the Restoration, they will have the strength to overcome their objections and concerns.
As you answer concerns, remember that our understanding comes from modern prophets—Joseph Smith and his successors—who receive direct revelation from God.
Therefore, the first question someone should answer is whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, and he or she can answer this question by reading and praying about the Book of Mormon.
