The Commitment to Stay Active in the Church
Missionary work has its greatest effect as people make and keep the commitment to stay active in the Church all the days of their lives.
It is not enough for people to simply come into the Church.
They must come to stay.
All of your teaching and invitations must be directed toward this end.
In order to receive all the blessings that our Heavenly Father has in store for them, members must continue to live the gospel and be active in the Church.
Nephi taught: “And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?
Behold, I say unto you, Nay; … ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ … and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” ( 2 Nephi 31:19–20 ).
Give your best efforts to help people qualify for “eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God” ( Doctrine and Covenants 14:7 ).
