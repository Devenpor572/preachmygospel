Endure to the End
As we continue to live the gospel, we grow closer to our Heavenly Father.
We enjoy and appreciate more the Atonement of the Savior.
Our families are drawn closer together.
We experience greater feelings of the love, joy, and peace that come from following the Savior and applying His Atonement.
Our hearts are changed, and we find security in living the restored gospel.
As we continue to exercise faith in Christ, repent, and renew our covenants, we enjoy continued guidance from the Holy Ghost.
If we endure to the end of our lives in being true to our covenants, we will receive exaltation.
President Russell M.
Nelson taught: “Keep on the covenant path.
… Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants will open the door to every spiritual privilege and blessing available to men, women, and children everywhere.
… The end for which each of us strives is to be endowed with a power in a house of the Lord, sealed as families—faithful to the covenants made in a temple that qualify us for the greatest gift of God, that of eternal life” (live telecast from the annex of the Salt Lake Temple, Jan.
16, 2018).
A few members do not endure or remain fully active.
However, enduring to the end is a personal responsibility.
We “work out [our] own salvation” ( Philippians 2:12 ), and we serve and love those whose faith has grown weak through inactivity.
