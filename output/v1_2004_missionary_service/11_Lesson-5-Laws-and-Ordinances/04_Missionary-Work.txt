Missionary Work
Members who share the gospel experience joy and have the Spirit of the Lord more abundantly.
As we share the gospel, we appreciate how precious and meaningful it is to us, and we feel a greater love for God and others.
The Lord commanded His followers to preach the gospel in all the world, giving every person the opportunity to accept or reject it.
When people are baptized, they make a covenant to always stand as witnesses of God.
They are commanded to share the gospel with those who have not yet received it.
As they live the gospel faithfully, they will set an example, showing their family members and friends the great blessings that come from living the gospel.
They should also take advantage of opportunities to answer questions, share printed materials or digital media, and invite others to learn more about the message of the restored gospel.
Members should pray for those who are not members of the Church.
They should pray for missionary opportunities—to serve those who are not of our faith and share what they believe.
The Lord promises to help members know what to say and do as they share the gospel.
