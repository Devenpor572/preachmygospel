Prepare to Teach
This lesson works much like lesson 4 .
The approach you take should be determined by the needs, interests, and situations of the people you are teaching and direction from the Spirit.
Constantly think and pray about how to help others live the gospel.
Be mindful of the questions and level of understanding of those you teach.
Ideas include:
Teaching one or more of the laws and ordinances from this lesson while reviewing “ The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ ,” “ The Plan of Salvation ,” and “ The Gospel of Jesus Christ ” lessons.
For example, while teaching the message of the Restoration you may want to teach about priesthood and missionary work; while teaching the plan of salvation you may teach about eternal marriage, temples and family history service, and teaching and learning in the Church.
While teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ you may want to teach about the strait and narrow way and serving in the Church.
Teaching two or three of the laws and ordinances as a single lesson.
Teaching a single law or ordinance as a lesson.
Work with members to help people you are teaching accept and begin living these laws and ordinances.
Help people recognize that by keeping God’s laws, they will retain a remission of their sins and stay on the pathway to exaltation.
They will experience greater peace and joy.
They will find answers to life’s questions and security in the knowledge that they belong to the true Church of Jesus Christ.
The laws and ordinances serve as directions for living joyfully, with faith in Jesus Christ and a firm hope of receiving exaltation with our Father in Heaven.
