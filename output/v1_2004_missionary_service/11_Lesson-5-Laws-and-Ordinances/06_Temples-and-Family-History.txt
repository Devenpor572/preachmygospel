Temples and Family History
God has commanded His people to build temples.
In the temple we make sacred covenants and are endowed with, or are given, a gift of power and knowledge from on high.
This power helps us in our daily lives and enables us to build God’s kingdom.
In the temple we can also be married for time and eternity, thus making it possible for families to be together forever in God’s presence.
After at least one year of membership, worthy adults may be eligible to receive from their bishop a recommend to receive their own endowment.
After receiving their endowments, married couples may be sealed or married for eternity.
The Savior loves all people and desires their salvation.
Yet millions of people have died without having any opportunity to hear the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ or receive saving ordinances.
Through His loving grace and mercy the Lord makes salvation possible for everyone who did not have the opportunity to receive, understand, and obey the gospel during their mortal lives.
The gospel is preached to these deceased people in the spirit world.
Members of the Church on earth perform the saving ordinances in behalf of their deceased ancestors and others.
Deceased persons living in the spirit world have the opportunity to accept or reject the gospel and the ordinances performed in their behalf.
For this reason, Church members search for information about their ancestors.
They can then add the information they find to the Church’s database at FamilySearch.org.
A person can do so either on their own or with the help of a temple and family history consultant.
The Church’s database then allows Church members to share or print out and take to the temple the names of deceased relatives who need to have saving ordinances performed on their behalf in sacred temples.
This is an important aspect of doing family history.
Worthy members of the appropriate age, including new members, are eligible to receive from their bishop a limited-use recommend to participate in performing baptisms and confirmations for these deceased ancestors.
Family History
Working with the ward mission leader, introduce those you are teaching and new converts to another ward member who is familiar with temple and family history service (such as a temple and family history consultant).
They can help those people identify their deceased relatives who are in need of temple ordinances.
Where possible, go with new members to the temple.
Participate with them in performing temple ordinances.
