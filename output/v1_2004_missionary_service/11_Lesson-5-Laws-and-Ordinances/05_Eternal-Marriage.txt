Eternal Marriage
The basic unit of the Church is the family.
Within the family, people experience many of life’s greatest joys and sorrows.
Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and is central to God’s eternal plan for the salvation of His children.
The means by which mortal life is created is divinely appointed and is safeguarded by marriage.
The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to endure beyond the grave.
Marriage, however, can be eternal only when authorized priesthood holders perform the sealing ordinance in sacred temples and when husbands and wives who have been sealed together keep the covenants they have made.
Husbands and wives are to love each other.
As they keep the commandments and live gospel principles, they are to honor their marital vows with complete fidelity (see “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 145; see also Doctrine and Covenants 42:22 ).
Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ and when parents make their family their highest priority.
“By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families.
Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children.
In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners” (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” 145).
Together, parents are to teach their children the gospel of Jesus Christ and help them live it.
Satan is making a concentrated attack on families.
Years ago Church leaders set aside one evening a week as a time for home evening.
Parents should use this time to teach their children the gospel, strengthen their relationships with them, and have fun together.
Other ways of strengthening the family include daily family prayer and scripture study, worshipping at church as a family, doing family history, and serving others.
Heaven is a continuation of the ideal family.
Through priesthood ordinances and righteous living, we can live as families in God’s presence eternally.
