Consider This
What does it mean to “find them that will receive you” ( Doctrine and Covenants 42:8 )?
How do I increase my faith to find people to teach?
Why should I involve members in my finding efforts?
What is the role of member, missionary, and Church headquarters referrals?
What is the relationship between finding and teaching?
What are some ideas for finding people to teach that I have not yet tried?
