No Effort Is Wasted
When people choose not to learn more about the restored gospel, your work is not wasted.
Your consistent efforts in serving and teaching as many people as you can are one way God prepares His children to eventually receive His servants.
He often reaches out to His children through you.
Even when people do not accept the opportunity to learn the gospel, your service and words are evidence of God’s love for them and may plant seeds that future missionaries and members of the Church will harvest.
When people do not accept the gospel, do not be discouraged.
You have raised a warning voice.
You have given them a clear choice.
Disciples of Christ feel sorrow when people choose not to repent, but they maintain a vision of who they are and what they are doing.
They continue to diligently move forward.
