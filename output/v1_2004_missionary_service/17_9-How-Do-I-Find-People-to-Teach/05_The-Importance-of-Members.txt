The Importance of Members
Work with members of the Church to find people to teach.
The ideal situation is when members invite others to be taught and are present for the teaching.
When members do this, more people are baptized and remain active in the Church.
Association with members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads them to learn more about the restored gospel.
This often means that they are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including active and returning members, recent converts, and part-member families.
“After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.”

President Gordon B.
Hinckley taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting.
Everyone who is familiar with this work knows there is a better way.
That way is through the members of the Church.
Whenever there is a member who introduces [someone], there is an immediate support system.
The member bears testimony of the truth of the work.
He is anxious for the happiness of his … friend.
He becomes excited as that friend makes progress in learning the gospel.
“The full-time missionaries may do the actual teaching, but the member, wherever possible, will back up that teaching with the offering of his home to carry on this missionary service.
He will bear sincere testimony of the divinity of the work.
He will be there to answer questions when the missionaries are not around.
He will be a friend to the convert who is making a big and often difficult change.
… The process of bringing new people into the Church is not the responsibility alone of the missionaries.
They succeed best when members become the source from which new [people] are found” (“ Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep ,” Ensign, May 1999, 105–6).
The starting point in building strong relationships with members is the bishop.
Offer to help and serve in any righteous way that he asks.
Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing or a burden to the bishop?” Develop a “How can I help?” attitude.
If you will look for opportunities to love, serve, and teach, the bishop and ward members will be more likely to trust you with their family members and friends.
Consider the following excerpt from a letter written by a missionary to his mission president:
Dear President,
The assistants called today telling me I’m being transferred.
I felt that I should write and thank you for sending me to this area.
It seems like it was just yesterday that you were telling me about the challenges that lay ahead.
Our first Sunday confirmed what you told me.
We received a lukewarm welcome to the ward.
The only ray of light that first Sunday was Scott, the new ward mission leader.
He had been transferred to the Air Force base a month earlier and had been serving as ward mission leader for two weeks.
Scott invited us to his home for dinner our first Sunday to discuss what could be done to get the work moving.
After dinner, we knelt in prayer and asked Heavenly Father for His direction.
As we prayed, we felt a sense of peace and determination.
We determined that the best way to move the work forward was to gain the trust of the members.
We decided to follow Ammon’s example and serve them.
We started with the bishop.
Because of the lack of baptisms in the area and the lack of effort from the previous missionaries, he was understandably less than excited at our request to meet with him.
He eventually invited us over to his home for dinner.
We learned that the bishop was preparing to remove the carpet from his living room and restore the hardwood floor found underneath.
We volunteered our help and he accepted.
At the conclusion of the project, the bishop asked us to speak in a sacrament meeting.
We took this as evidence that he was beginning to trust us.
We followed this same pattern of service as we met with other members.
We found opportunities to help them in a variety of simple ways.
When we were not with the members, we were knocking on doors and talking to as many people as we could about the restored gospel.
We were blessed with people to teach, and the members saw us bringing people to church whom we were finding on our own.
The attitude of the whole ward began to change.
There was an increasing excitement about missionary work.
Once the members trusted us, the work hastened.
Many baptisms followed.
Many members of the Church have fears about doing missionary work.
Many are unsure where to begin or what to say.
Many fear that they will lose close friends if they try to share the gospel with them.
There are many ways to help the members.
For example, help build their faith by teaching them the message of the Restoration and other doctrine in the lessons.
Help them feel the Spirit and power of our message.
Strengthening their understanding of the doctrine of Christ will do more to increase their trust in you and to build their excitement to do missionary work than anything else you can do.
Help them understand that offering the restored gospel will flow more naturally out of relationships where they are seeking to love and serve their family members and friends.
Teach them the principles from the “Go About Doing Good” section (see chapter 1 ).
Encourage members to “join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who [know] not God” ( Alma 6:6 ).
In all you do with members, seek to lift and build their faith to help them do missionary work.
In addition to working with active members, seek to find people to teach through part-member families, prospective elders, returning members, and new members.
These members are likely to have many friends of other faiths and be blessed as they share the restored gospel with their family members and friends.
In every visit with members, do all you can to encourage them to:
Pray and follow the Spirit.
Give service.
Develop friendships.
Open their mouths to share the restored gospel.
Invite others to do things to increase their faith in Christ.
Every referral you receive from a member should be treated as something precious.
When a member gives you the name of a friend to call or visit, respond quickly and report the results back to the member.
Invite the member to help you teach.
Ideas for Helping Members
There are many ways to encourage members to become more involved in missionary work.
Consider the following ideas:
Seek the guidance of the bishop and other ward leaders.
See chapter 13 for additional help in this area.
Teach Church leaders and members the message of the Restoration and other lessons.
Teach them to love and serve their neighbors, friends, and communities.
They can find opportunities to serve at JustServe.org .
Encourage them to fast and pray for missionary opportunities.
Encourage them to visit acquaintances who have recently experienced a life-changing event (birth, death in the family, marriage, or recent move).
Invite them to help you teach.
The ideal situation is to have a Church member with you who formerly belonged to the same church as the person you are teaching.
Help them set dates when they will invite their friends to learn about the message of the Restoration.
Show them items they can give others, such as copies of the Book of Mormon, videos, and pass-along cards.
Encourage them to invite their friends to attend church or home evening, to view a Church-produced video, or to participate in a gospel conversation.
Help them practice what they could say to their friends.
Help them know what they might say on social media that could lead to a conversation about the gospel.
Help them understand that as they refer friends to meet with missionaries, they can participate in lessons in person or through technology.
See the Church’s website for more information.
Teach them why it is valuable to share the gospel regardless of the outcome.
There are many other ways to help members get more involved.
