The Power and Authority of Your Calling
Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” ( Doctrine and Covenants 79:1 ).
As a missionary, you have authority to preach the gospel.
President Dallin H.
Oaks has taught: “Whoever functions in an office or calling received from one who holds priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties” (“ The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood ,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2014, 51).
As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call.
Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission.
Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see Alma 17:2–3 ).
If you hold the priesthood, you also have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof.
When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord.
You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world.
President Spencer W.
Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar; set apart from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity.
The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” ( The Teachings of Spencer W.
Kimball, ed.
Edward L.
Kimball [1982], 478).
Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling.
As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” ( 1 Timothy 4:12 ).
Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; and love the people with whom you serve and work.
Honor Christ’s name by your actions.
In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work.
The authority that you have received can lead to power.
Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real.
Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively.
Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach.
Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as:
Being led by the Spirit to say what the Lord would have you say at just the right moment (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:85 ).
Receiving guidance about where to go or what to do (see Doctrine and Covenants 28:15 ; 31:11 ; 75:26–27 ).
Having your testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1 ; Doctrine and Covenants 100:5–8 ).
Taking part in ordinances of salvation (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–20 ).
Giving priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15 ).
Praying with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6 ; 8:18–22 ; 10:7–11 ; 31:26–35 ; Doctrine and Covenants 75:19 ).
Expressing love for the Lord, your family, fellow missionaries, and the people you serve.
