Your Purpose
Invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
Consider This
What is my purpose as a missionary?
What is the gospel of Jesus Christ?
Why do we preach the gospel?
Why must I teach with power and authority?
What is the message of the Restoration?
Why is it so important?
What is my responsibility in helping others become converted?
How will I know whether I am a successful missionary?
