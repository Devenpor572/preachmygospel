Establishing The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
When people have been baptized and confirmed members of the Church, continue to work with ward leaders and members to help these new converts adjust to their new life and continue their spiritual growth.
The Church is established as people who have testimonies are baptized and confirmed, keep their covenants, prepare actively to go to the temple, and help strengthen the ward or branch.
Converts who have member friends, who are given responsibility, and who are nourished by Godâ€™s word will grow in testimony and faith.
Missionaries, local leaders, and Church members should not turn away from their responsibility to nourish and strengthen new members.
