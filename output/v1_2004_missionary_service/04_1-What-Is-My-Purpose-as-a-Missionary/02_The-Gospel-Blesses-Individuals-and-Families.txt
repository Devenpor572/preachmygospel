The Gospel Blesses Individuals and Families
The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses individuals and families.
Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for His children: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave.
Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 145).

On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy.
Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts.
The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is that all individuals are part of God’s family and that families can be united now and in eternity.
By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life.
Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges.
Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
“Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.
Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” 145).
Strive to find and teach families—a father, mother, and children—who can support one another in living the gospel and eventually be sealed as a family unit by restored priesthood authority.
