Teaching by the Spirit
Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” ( Romans 1:16 ), the message of the Restoration of the gospel must be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the third member of the Godhead.
He is often called the Spirit, and one of His roles is to teach and testify of the truth.
As you teach by that power, the Holy Ghost will:
Teach you new truths and bring the doctrine you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26 ).
Give you words to speak in the very moment you need them (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:85 ).
Carry your message to the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1 ).
Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words (see Doctrine and Covenants 100:5–8 ).
Help you discern the needs of the people you are teaching (see Alma 12:7 ).
The Spirit is essential for teaching the truths of the gospel in a way that builds faith in others.
As you strive to develop the faith to rely on the Spirit, you should:
Pray for the Spirit (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:14 ).
Purify your heart (see Doctrine and Covenants 112:28 ).
Keep the commandments (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ).
Diligently treasure up God’s word (see Doctrine and Covenants 11:21 ; 84:85 ).
Teach so that others understand your message and are edified (see Doctrine and Covenants 50:13–22 ).
Exercise faith (see Moroni 10:7 ).
You have been set apart for your sacred calling with the promise that the Spirit will be given as you meet the requirements set by the Lord.
Enjoying the gifts of the Spirit should be one of your most earnest desires.
