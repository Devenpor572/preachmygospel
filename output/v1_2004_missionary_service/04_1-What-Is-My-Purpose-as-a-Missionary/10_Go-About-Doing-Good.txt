Go About Doing Good
During His mortal ministry, the Savior “took upon him the form of a servant” ( Philippians 2:7 ).
He went about “doing good” ( Acts 10:38 ) and “preaching the gospel” ( Matthew 4:23 ).
As you follow this example, you will find those whom you can serve and who will receive you.
Through service, you fulfill the two great commandments of loving God and your neighbor (see Matthew 22:36–40 ).
Through service, you and those who are prepared for the restored gospel may also come together in a powerful, inspiring way.
Your good works will help some people recognize you as a servant of God and may lead to opportunities to teach the restored gospel.
However, Christlike service should be offered as a sincere expression of love for those around you, without the expectation of people listening to a gospel message or accepting a teaching visit.
Many missionaries’ experience with service before their missions involved planned “service projects,” such as helping someone move, cleaning a local meetinghouse, or helping someone with yardwork.
As a missionary, you will offer such planned service each week (see the Missionary Handbook for additional information).
Under the direction of your mission president, you may find opportunities to serve in the community through JustServe (where it is approved), and the Church’s humanitarian and disaster response efforts.
The type of service described in this section focuses on unplanned opportunities.
This type of service involves listening to the Spirit to recognize opportunities for small acts of kindness that you can offer to God’s children.
Pray and be aware of opportunities throughout each day to do good.
“Do you want to be happy?
Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause.
Lend your efforts to helping people.
… Stand higher, lift those with feeble knees, hold up the arms of those that hang down.
Live the gospel of Jesus Christ.”
