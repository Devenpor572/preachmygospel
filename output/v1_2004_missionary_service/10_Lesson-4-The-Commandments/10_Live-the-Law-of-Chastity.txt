Live the Law of Chastity
God delights in chastity.
Chastity means limiting all sexual relations to one husband (for women) or one wife (for men).
It also means strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one’s spouse after marriage.
Those who live the law of chastity enjoy the strength that comes from self-control.
They enjoy confidence and trust in their family relationships.
They can enjoy more fully the influence of the Holy Ghost in their lives.
Those who break this law are subject to a lasting sense of shame and guilt that burdens their lives.
Chastity requires faithfulness in thought and action.
We must keep our thoughts clean and be modest in our dress, speech, and actions.
We must avoid pornography in any form.
We should treat the God-given procreative power and our bodies as sacred.
Sexual relations are a God-given power to procreate and strengthen a married couple’s bond.
People who experience same-sex attraction should also keep the law of chastity and keep covenants with God.
Experiencing same-sex attraction or identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual is not a sin and does not prohibit one from participating in the Church, holding callings, or attending the temple.
Baptismal candidates are to live the law of chastity, which prohibits any sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between one man and one woman.
They are not to participate in abortions or homosexual relations.
Because God loves all His children and reaches out to them in love through Jesus Christ (see Romans 5:8 ), those who have committed sexual sin can repent, be forgiven, and live after the manner of happiness (see 2 Nephi 5:27 ).
Couples Living Together
Men and women who are living together but are not married may not be baptized without first getting married or separated.
People in same-sex marriages or same-sex relationships, or those who are married to more than one person at a time, may not be baptized.
The invitation to live the law of chastity may pose very difficult challenges to the people you are teaching.
Be prayerful and sensitive to each person’s situation.
Use caution and follow the promptings of the Spirit when discussing sexual behavior to avoid compromising situations or accusations.
Seek counsel from your mission president, who will give you specific direction in each case.
