Baptism and Confirmation
The way we show our desire to follow in God’s way is through baptism and confirmation.
When we are baptized and confirmed, we enter into a covenant with God that we will take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and that we will always remember Him and keep His commandments.
We also promise to stand as witnesses of God at all times and to assist those in need (see Mosiah 18:8–9 ).
In return, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again.
