Obedience
God gives us commandments for our benefit.
They are instructions from a loving Father in Heaven to help us have happy lives.
He also gives us agency, or the ability and opportunity to choose between good and evil.
When we obey God, we follow the influence of the Spirit and choose to conform to His will.
Obedience to the commandments brings us peace in this life and eternal life and exaltation in the world to come.
Obedience shows our love for God.
Disobedience brings us sorrow.
Heavenly Father knows our weaknesses and is patient with us.
He blesses us as we rely upon His Son and strive to obey His commandments.
He expects us to obey Him so He can bless us.
