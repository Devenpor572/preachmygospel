Obey the Word of Wisdom
The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith a law of health called the Word of Wisdom.
This law teaches us what foods and substances we should and should not use to maintain the health of our bodies and to keep us free from evil influences.
The Lord promises blessings of health, strength, protection against evil, and greater receptiveness to spiritual truths.
Remember that our bodies are sacred.
We should treat them with respect and reverence.
The Word of Wisdom teaches that we are to eat healthy foods.
It teaches very specifically that we are to avoid harmful substances, including alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee.
We must also avoid harmful drugs in any form.
To be baptized and confirmed, those you teach must give up these substances.
People who obey the Word of Wisdom are more receptive to spiritual truths.

Pray for them in your personal prayers and when you are with them.
Be positive and supportive—even if they relapse.
Continue teaching them the gospel.

Help them attend church regularly and develop friendships with people who live the Word of Wisdom and have overcome the same addiction.
As appropriate, offer to give them priesthood blessings.
