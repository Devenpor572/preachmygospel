The Power of the Spirit in Conversion
The power of the Holy Ghost is central to conversion.
Strive to understand the doctrine and also the experience of conversion.
President Boyd K.
Packer explained the central role of the Spirit in conversion:
“When conversion takes place, it is through the power of the Spirit.
In order to succeed in missionary work, these three things must occur:
“We must understand what [a person] must feel in order to receive conversion.
“We must understand how a missionary must feel in order to teach with the converting power of the Spirit.
“And then we must understand how a member must feel to succeed in participating in the conversion experience” (mission presidents’ conference, Apr.
3, 1985).
The better you understand how the people you teach, missionaries, and members feel when they receive the witness of the Spirit, the better you will understand your own role, which is to:
Be edified and have your mind enlightened as you search the scriptures and teach the doctrine.
Create a climate when you teach in which the Holy Ghost can bear witness.
You do this by teaching and testifying of the message of the Restoration.
Teach as directed by the Spirit, and testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true.
Follow the guidance of the Spirit in adapting the message to each person’s needs.
Invite people to act.
Their faith will grow as they repent, obey the commandments, and make and keep covenants.
President M.
Russell Ballard spoke of the power of the Spirit: “True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit.
When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed.
When individuals … feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases.
These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word.
This is how we come to feel the gospel is true” (“ Now Is the Time ,” Ensign, Nov.
2000, 75).
The Holy Ghost works in the hearts of people to bring about these changes.
As people choose to keep commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly and will develop the faith to obey Christ.
Thus, you should help the people you work with grow in faith by inviting them to repent and to make and keep commitments.
