A Word of Caution
As you pray for inspiration, you should also confirm your feelings.
For example, compare your decisions with the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets.
Be certain that the feelings are consistent with the assignment you have; for example, you will not receive revelation to tell a local bishop how he should perform in his calling.
Discuss your decisions and conclusions with your companion, your district leader, or your mission president when appropriate.
President Howard W.
Hunter offered this counsel: “Let me offer a word of caution.
… I think if we are not careful … , we may begin to try to counterfeit the true influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and manipulative means.
I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit.
Certainly the Spirit of the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself” ( The Teachings of Howard W.
Hunter [1997], 184).
The Spirit of the Lord always edifies.
Revelation and spiritual experiences are sacred.
They should be kept private and discussed only in appropriate situations.
As a missionary, you may be more aware of spiritual experiences than you have been earlier in your life.
Resist the temptation to talk freely about these experiences.
President Boyd K.
Packer counseled: “I have learned that strong, impressive spiritual experiences do not come to us very frequently.
And when they do, they are generally for our own edification, instruction, or correction.
Unless we are called by proper authority to do so, they do not position us to counsel or to correct others.
“I have come to believe also that it is not wise to continually talk of unusual spiritual experiences.
They are to be guarded with care and shared only when the Spirit itself prompts you to use them to the blessing of others” (“ The Candle of the Lord ,” 53).
“If worthy, we are entitled to receive revelations for ourselves, parents for their children, and members of the Church in their callings.
But the right of revelation for others does not extend beyond our own stewardship.”
