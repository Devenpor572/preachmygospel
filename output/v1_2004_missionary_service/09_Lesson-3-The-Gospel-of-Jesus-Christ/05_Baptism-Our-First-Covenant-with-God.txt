Baptism, Our First Covenant with God
Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation.
An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God.
God has always required His children to make covenants.
A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and His children.
God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him.
God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject.
Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come.
Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our promises to God.
We should desire to worthily receive the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them.
Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives, relying upon Jesus Christ.
By loving the Lord, keeping His commandments, and loving and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins through “him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood” ( Revelation 1:5 ).
Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism.
These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority in the name of Jesus Christ.
Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments.
As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again.
Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:20 ).
Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins.
Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation.
No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized by the Lord’s authorized servant.
Christ set the example for us by being baptized.
Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and Resurrection of the Savior.
In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ.
The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth.
When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8 ; Romans 8:14–17 ).
We must be baptized to become members of His kingdom on earth, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven.
This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority and in His name (see Matthew 28:19–20 ).
A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation.
Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24 ).
They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:27 ).
Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the commandments for the rest of our lives.
After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenant.
We also regularly renew the covenant we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament.
Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment.
It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always.
It is a weekly reminder of our covenant.
Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement.
He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith.
The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us.
By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us.
Before Baptism
Ensure that those you teach have developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions by relying upon the sacrifice of the Savior, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 .
Those you teach “must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men [and women]” ( 2 Nephi 31:20 ).
Additionally, they must promise to live the principles of moral worthiness, obey the Word of Wisdom, and obey the law of tithing.
If you feel additional preparation is needed, you should postpone baptism until those you teach meet the standard outlined by the Lord in scripture.
(See “Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, Dec.
11, 2002.)
“Before baptism each [person] should receive all the missionary [lessons], meet the bishop or branch president, and attend several sacrament meetings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, Dec.
11, 2002).
