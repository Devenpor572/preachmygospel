Endure to the End
The gospel of Jesus Christ includes obtaining and increasing our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting of our sins through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, being baptized by immersion by an authorized servant of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ, receiving baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and enduring to the end.
Enduring to the end does not simply mean holding on until we die.
Enduring to the end includes obtaining Christlike attributes through the Savior’s Atonement.
Enduring to the end includes following the Father’s will and obeying His commandments, fasting, prayer, scripture study, observing the Sabbath day, repenting, and making and keeping sacred temple covenants.
Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path.
We do so by continually exercising faith in and relying upon Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit.
Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us.
In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives.
If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant.
We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example.
In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.”
By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly.
As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for exaltation (see page 53 for additional information regarding the difference between salvation and exaltation).
Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living.
Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles.
Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes.
Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ … and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” and exaltation ( 2 Nephi 31:20 ; see also Doctrine and Covenants 132:17 ).

Invitation to Be Baptized
As directed by the Spirit, the invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?
We will be holding a baptismal service on [date].
Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?”
