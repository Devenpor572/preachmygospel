The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life and exaltation.
The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost.
We must then endure to the end.
By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes.

Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes)
Our message is one of faith and hope.
We love and worship Jesus Christ.
He is central to God’s plan for our happiness.
Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have exaltation in the presence of God.
As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins.
He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life.
The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple.
It begins with faith in Christ.
We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him.
Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right.
Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism.
After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost.
The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth.
We can know in our hearts and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us.
We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy.
We will want to serve others.
We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord.
Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet.
We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about.
God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true.
As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost.

Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes)
The Divine Mission of Jesus Christ
God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, into the world (see John 3:16–17 ).
Only through Christ’s grace and mercy can we become clean from sin (see 2 Nephi 2:6–8 ).
Because of the Savior’s sacrifice, known as the Atonement of Christ, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16 ).
We are responsible to accept Christ, repent, and obey.
The Gospel of Christ and Doctrine of Christ
The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:12 ).
The gospel of Jesus Christ includes faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance through the Atonement of Christ, baptism by immersion in Christ’s name, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end (see 2 Nephi 31 ; 3 Nephi 11 ; 27 ).
The Book of Mormon also teaches us what we must believe about Jesus Christ in order to have faith in Him (see 3 Nephi 27:13–15 ).
Faith in Jesus Christ
We are to believe in Christ as the Savior of the world.
He wants us to accept and follow His teachings.
We receive blessings when we obey (see Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21 ).
Repentance through the Atonement of Jesus Christ
Faith in Christ leads to repentance (see Alma 34 ).
We feel godly sorrow (see 2 Corinthians 7:9–10 ).
We stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right.
We confess our sins to the Lord, and we also confess serious sins to Church leaders, who can help us repent (see Doctrine and Covenants 58:43 ).
We receive forgiveness; guilt and sorrow are replaced by peace (see Alma 36:17–21 ).
Baptism, Our First Covenant with God
An ordinance is a sacred rite by which we make covenants with God.
A covenant is a solemn agreement between God and His children.
Keeping covenants brings blessings.
We are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins (see Articles of Faith 1:4 ).
When we are baptized we begin a new life of commitment to Christ (see Romans 6:3–8 ).
Baptism must be performed by one holding priesthood authority.
We renew our covenant by partaking of the sacrament weekly ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ).
The Gift of the Holy Ghost
Baptism by immersion is followed by baptism of the Spirit; the two are inseparable.
Priesthood holders confer the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.
The Holy Ghost teaches us, cleanses us, comforts us, testifies of the truth, warns us, and directs us (see 2 Nephi 32:1–5 ; Mosiah 5:1–6 ; Moroni 10:5 ; Doctrine and Covenants 36:2 ).
Endure to the End
We must continue on the path once we have been baptized and confirmed.
We do our best to remain free of sin so that we can enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost.
By faithfully following the gospel path of faith, repentance, making and keeping covenants, and receiving the Holy Ghost, we can qualify for eternal life and exaltation by being true to covenants made in the holy temple (see 2 Nephi 31:14–20 ; Doctrine and Covenants 132:17 ).
We must continually repent throughout our lives (see Doctrine and Covenants 19:15–20 ).

Key Definitions
Confirmation: The laying on of hands by those holding the Melchizedek Priesthood in order to become a member of the Church and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Covenant: An agreement between God and His children.
We do not act as equals in the agreement.
God gives the conditions for the covenant, and we agree to do what He asks us to do.
God then promises us certain blessings for our obedience.
We receive ordinances by covenant.
When we make such covenants, we promise to honor them.
For example, members of the Church covenant with the Lord at baptism and renew that covenant by partaking of the sacrament.
We make further covenants in the temple.
The Lord’s people are a covenant people.
We are greatly blessed as we keep our covenants with the Lord.
Endure to the end: To remain true to the commandments of God and be true to the endowment and sealing ordinances of the temple despite temptation, opposition, and adversity throughout life.
Exaltation: To live forever as families in God’s presence (see Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–20 ).
Exaltation is God’s greatest gift to His sons and daughters.
Gospel: God’s plan of salvation, made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
The gospel includes the eternal truths or laws, covenants, and ordinances needed for mankind to return to the presence of God.
Grace: The enabling power from Jesus Christ that allows us to obtain blessings in this life and to gain eternal life and exaltation after we have exercised faith, repented, and given our best effort to keep the commandments.
Such divine help or strength is given through the mercy and love of Jesus Christ.
We all need divine grace because of Adam and Eve’s Fall and also because of our weaknesses.
Mercy: The spirit of compassion, tenderness, and forgiveness.
Mercy is one of the attributes of God.
Jesus Christ offers mercy to us through His atoning sacrifice on conditions of repentance.
