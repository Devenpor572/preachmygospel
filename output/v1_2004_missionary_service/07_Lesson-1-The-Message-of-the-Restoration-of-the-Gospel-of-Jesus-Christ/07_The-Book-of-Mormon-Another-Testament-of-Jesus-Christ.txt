The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ
Knowing that doubt, disbelief, and misinformation would remain after centuries of darkness, our loving Heavenly Father brought forth an ancient volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible, which contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ.
This volume of holy scripture provides convincing evidence that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God.
This record is the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.
Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly messenger named Moroni to a hill where golden plates had lain hidden for centuries.
These golden plates contained the writings of prophets giving an account of God’s dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas.
Joseph Smith translated the contents of these plates by the power of God.
The prophets in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of the Savior and taught His gospel.
After His Resurrection, Christ appeared to these people.
He taught them His gospel and established His Church.
The Book of Mormon proves that “God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old” ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:11 ).
In order to know that the Book of Mormon is true, a person must read it and ponder and pray about it.
The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God.
Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion.
Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth.
Use the Book of Mormon to Confirm the Truth of the Restoration
Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon:
“God loves His children, so He provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said.
It is the Book of Mormon.
Would you please read the last two paragraphs in the introduction to the book?”
Carefully explain the meaning of each concept in both paragraphs and invite those you teach to read portions of the Book of Mormon and to apply the principles described in these two paragraphs.
When introducing a person to the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally meaningful to you or that might be meaningful to him or her.
