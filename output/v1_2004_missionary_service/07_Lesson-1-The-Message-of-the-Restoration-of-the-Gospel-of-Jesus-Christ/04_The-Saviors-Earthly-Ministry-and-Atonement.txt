The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement
A few hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ, people again fell into apostasy.
But when the Savior began His mortal ministry He established His Church again on the earth.
Heavenly Father sent His Son to the earth to atone for the sins of all mankind and overcome death: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son … that the world through him might be saved” ( John 3:16–17 ).
Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take upon Him, by His suffering, the sins of all who would live on this earth and to overcome physical death.
The Savior made an infinite atoning sacrifice so that if we have faith in Him, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end, we can receive forgiveness of our sins and enter and follow the path that will lead us to eternal life in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 31:13–21 ).
During His earthly ministry, the Savior taught His gospel and performed many miracles.
He called twelve men to be His Apostles and laid His hands on their heads to give them priesthood authority.
He organized His Church, fulfilled prophecy, and was rejected and crucified.
Most important, He completed the Atonement.
The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, completed all that His Heavenly Father sent Him to do.
Before the Savior’s death and Resurrection, He gave His Apostles authority to teach His gospel, perform the ordinances of salvation, and establish His Church in the world.
