This message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ is either true or it is not.
We can know that it is true by the power of the Holy Ghost, as promised in Moroni 10:3–5 .
Consistent study of the scriptures (particularly the Book of Mormon), regular church attendance, and sincere prayer help us feel the power of the Holy Ghost and discover truth.
After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask our Heavenly Father in prayer in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true.
Because God is our Father and we are His children, He will help us recognize truth.
When we pray with faith, sincerity, and real intent—a commitment to act on the answers we receive—God will answer our questions, guide our lives, and help us make good decisions.
When we pray, we address our Heavenly Father.
We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true.
No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer.
In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts.
Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet.
As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration.
Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him.
Prayer
Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, it is rarely considered to be a two-way communication between God and man.
Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer.
Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson.
Use simple language that they can also use when they pray.
Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds.
If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them.
Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson.

Invitation to Be Baptized
As directed by the Spirit, during this or any other lesson, do not hesitate to invite people to be baptized and confirmed.
To prepare people for an invitation to be baptized and confirmed, teach the doctrine of baptism and testify often of the importance of all people being baptized by authority, of receiving a remission of sins, and of the wonderful gift of the Holy Ghost.
You might say, “As the Lord answers your prayers and you feel that this message is true, will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized?”
The invitation to be baptized and confirmed should be specific and direct: “Will you follow the example of Jesus Christ by being baptized by someone holding the priesthood authority of God?
We will be holding a baptismal service on (date).
Will you prepare yourself to be baptized on that date?”
