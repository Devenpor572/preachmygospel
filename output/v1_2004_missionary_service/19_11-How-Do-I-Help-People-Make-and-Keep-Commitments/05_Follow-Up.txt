Follow Up
Extending an invitation without following up is like beginning a journey without finishing it or buying a ticket to a concert without going into the theater.
Without the completed action, the commitment is hollow.
Change can be hard.
Your role is to help strengthen people in their resolve to change.
You should do all you can to help people keep their commitments.
Genuine repentance is best demonstrated by righteous actions over a period of time, especially for commandments such as chastity, the Word of Wisdom, and tithing.
As you and ward leaders work with people to help them keep their commitments, show understanding.
Be patient but persistent.
You have not finished your ministry until people are living these commitments, or in other words, until they have repented (see 3 Nephi 18:32 ).
Sometimes several visits may be necessary for you to help people develop strong enough faith in a principle to lead to repentance.
Following up begins when you first visit and teach people:
Have them record their commitment, perhaps on their phone or calendar or on something you leave with them, such as a card with your names and phone number.
Make sure people know that you or member friends will make brief contact with them daily between teaching appointments.
Determine which method of communication they would prefer (brief visit, phone call, text message, email, social media message, and so on).
Explain that your purpose in following up is to support and help them.
Give them an idea of what you will do when you make contact each day.
Be respectful of people’s time and wishes.
Make daily contact positive and comfortable to encourage and uplift those you teach.
Record specific notes to follow up tomorrow on every invitation you have extended today.
Make frequent contact, daily if possible, to find out how people are progressing with their commitments, answer questions, help them overcome challenges, teach additional lessons, read together from the Book of Mormon, share passages of scripture, introduce them to members, or share relevant Church media.
As you contact and visit people often, you will strengthen the spiritual feelings they felt as you taught them the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
This sustaining influence of the Spirit is vital.
There may be times when you call the people you are teaching to remind and encourage them to keep a commitment.
Help people identify the blessings they have received as they have kept their commitments.
Especially help them describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness of the message.
Compliment and encourage people who are succeeding in keeping commitments.
The people you are teaching are changing their lives.
They have a lot to learn and to do.
Sincerely and frequently praise them.
Express your gratitude for their progress and your confidence that they can succeed.
Encourage them whenever you are with them.
Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings.
Activity: Personal or Companion Study
Write in your daily planner your plans for daily contact with each person you are teaching.
Plan several days in advance what you will do to follow up with each person.
Choose one invitation you will extend when you teach the lessons.
Then identify different concerns which might keep someone from accepting or keeping that commitment.
Discuss and practice how you can best help people as they work to resolve their concerns.
