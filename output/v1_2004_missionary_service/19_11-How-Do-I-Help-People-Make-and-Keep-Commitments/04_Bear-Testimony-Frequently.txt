Bear Testimony Frequently
A testimony is a spiritual witness and assurance given by the Holy Ghost.
To bear testimony is to give a simple, direct declaration of belief—a feeling, an assurance, a conviction of gospel truth.
Sharing your testimony often is one of the most powerful ways of inviting the Spirit and helping others feel the Spirit.
It adds a current, personal witness to the truths you have taught from the scriptures.
An effective missionary teaches, testifies, and invites others to do things that build faith in Jesus Christ.
This includes making promises that come from living true principles.
For example, a missionary might say, “I know as you keep the Sabbath day holy, you will find more peace in your heart.”
“Regarding one’s testimony, remember, that which one willingly shares he keeps, while that which he selfishly keeps he loses.
… Teach and testify.
There is no better combination.”
—President Thomas S.
Monson

For your testimony to have convincing power, you must be sincere.
Powerful testimony is not dependent on eloquence or the volume of your voice but on the conviction of your heart.
Strive daily to strengthen your understanding and conviction of the doctrine and principles you are to teach.
Bear testimony often to seal the truth of the principles or doctrine you are teaching.
As often as possible, teach, then testify, and testify as you teach.
Your testimony may be as simple as “Jesus Christ is the Son of God” or “I have learned for myself that the Book of Mormon is true.” You may also share a brief experience about how you gained this knowledge.
Bear testimony several times in each lesson, not just at the end.
Bear testimony that what your companion has taught is from God.
Bear testimony that the principle you are going to teach will bless the person’s life if he or she will follow it.
Talk about how living a principle has blessed your life.
People may sometimes intellectually question what you teach, but it is difficult to question a sincere, heartfelt testimony.
When you testify, pray that those you are teaching will feel the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost.
When you testify, you help create an environment for people to feel the Holy Ghost confirming your witness of the truth.
This prepares them to accept the invitations you will extend.
Brigham Young was not baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the first year of his learning about the restored gospel.
But of his conversion he said: “If all the talent, tact, wisdom, and refinement of the world had been sent to me with the Book of Mormon, and had declared, in the most exalted of earthly eloquence, the truth of it, undertaking to prove it by learning and worldly wisdom, they would have been to me like smoke which arises only to vanish away.
But when I saw a man without eloquence or talents for public speaking, who could only say, ‘I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord,’ the Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminated my understanding, and a light, glory, and immortality were before me.
I was encircled by them, filled with them, and I knew for myself that the testimony of the man was true” (in Journal of Discourses, 1:90).
