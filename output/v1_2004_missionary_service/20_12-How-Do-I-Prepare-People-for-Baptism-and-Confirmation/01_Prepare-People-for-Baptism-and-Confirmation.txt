Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation
The purpose of your teaching is to help others develop faith in Jesus Christ and repent of their sins.
As Mormon taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” ( Moroni 8:25 ).
The baptismal interview is the way established by the Church to ensure that each candidate meets the Lord’s standards for baptism and is prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Through this interview, baptismal candidates fulfill the scriptural requirement that they witness before an authorized representative of the Church that they have “truly repented of all their sins” ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 ).
The commitments that people make prepare them to make and keep the covenant of baptism, be confirmed a member of the Church, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, enter the temple with a limited-use recommend, and receive the Aaronic Priesthood (for males of the appropriate age).
People who have kept the commitments that you invited them to make will be well prepared for the interview and for membership and activity in the Church.
As you teach people and prepare them for baptism and confirmation, make sure that they meet the qualifications for baptism.
As they embark on the covenant path, remember that path leads to the holy temple, where they receive blessings necessary for eternal life.

When a person has set a firm baptismal date, schedule when you will complete all the events that lead to baptism and confirmation as listed in your daily planner.
Carefully review the Teaching Record to ensure that you have taught the basic doctrine and that the candidates are prepared to address each question in the baptismal interview.
Review this schedule with the person in your next meeting.
If possible, the person should attend a baptismal service prior to his or her own baptism.
If you feel that the person you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule an interview until he or she meets the standards.
If the candidate is a minor, ensure that the parents or guardians have given permission, preferably in writing, for him or her to be baptized.
As you help people prepare for their baptismal interview, talk to them about the purpose of the interview.
Teach them and bear testimony about the sacredness of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Explain that you want to make sure they understand the principles you have taught and the covenant they will make.
Also explain that the interview is an opportunity for them to witness before the Lord’s representative that they are ready for these sacred ordinances.
As they keep the baptismal covenant, they will receive a remission of sins.
Share the questions the interviewer will ask about their belief in important gospel doctrine, their repentance of past sins, and their willingness to covenant to obey Jesus Christ throughout their lives.
Emphasize that baptism by water is incomplete without baptism by fire through the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Remind the person that immediately after baptism and confirmation, he or she is worthy and eligible to receive a limited-use recommend to enter the temple to perform baptisms for deceased ancestors, and males of the appropriate age may also be ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood.
This will help set the person on the path toward making temple covenants that open the door to eternal life.
