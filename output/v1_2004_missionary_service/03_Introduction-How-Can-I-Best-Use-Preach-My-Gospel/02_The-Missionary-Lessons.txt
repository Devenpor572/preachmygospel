The Missionary Lessons
You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation.
Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through the first principles of the gospel, including faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
A lesson should rarely go over 45 minutes.
You may find that a personâ€™s schedule or your own time commitments may only allow shorter teaching visits.
In that case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material.
You can teach the lessons in many ways.
Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the person you are teaching and the direction of the Spirit.
Do not memorize the entire lesson.
