Listen
When you listen carefully to others, you understand them better.
When they know that their thoughts and feelings are important to you, they are more likely to be receptive to your teachings, share personal experiences, and make commitments.
As you listen, you will be able to more effectively adapt your teaching to their needs and interests.
Especially listen for the whisperings of the Spirit.
As others share their feelings with you, thoughts or ideas may enter your mind that are directed by the Spirit.
You will also be able to understand what others are trying to express.
While others talk to you, avoid the tendency to think about what you are going to say.
Make sure you are really concentrating on the person speaking rather than planning your response.
Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland taught: “More important than speaking is listening.
These people are not lifeless objects disguised as a baptismal statistic.
They are children of God, our brothers and sisters, and they need what we have.
Be genuine.
Reach out sincerely.
Ask these friends what matters most to them.
What do they cherish, and what do they hold dear?
And then listen.
If the setting is right, you might ask what their fears are, what they yearn for, or what they feel is missing in their lives.
I promise you that something in what they say will always highlight a truth of the gospel about which you can bear testimony and about which you can then offer more.
… If we listen with love, we won’t need to wonder what to say.
It will be given to us—by the Spirit and by our friends” (“ Witnesses unto Me ,” Ensign, May 2001, 15; italics in original).
People also communicate by the way they sit, their facial expressions, what they do with their hands, their tone of voice, and the movements of their eyes.
Observe these unspoken messages; they can help you understand the feelings of those you teach.
Also be aware of your own body language.
Send a message of interest and enthusiasm by listening sincerely.
Do not be afraid of silence.
People often need time to think about and reply to questions or to express what they are feeling.
You might pause after you have asked a question, after sharing a spiritual experience, or when people are having difficulty expressing themselves.
Be sure to give people time to complete their thoughts before you respond, and do not interrupt while they are talking.
When you feel that you understand what is being said, make comments that show you understand, such as “So what you are saying is _____.
Is that right?” or “If I understand, you are feeling that _____.” When you are not sure if you understand, ask the person for clarification.
Some people may tend to dominate the conversation and keep you from teaching the restored gospel.
You will need to learn to take control of such situations tactfully.
For example, “We appreciate what you are sharing with us, but that is an issue we would like to discuss later.
I will ask my companion to write it down so we will be sure not to forget to treat it on a later visit.” Remember, you will help people most by teaching them the gospel of Jesus Christ.
As you listen carefully, the Spirit will help you know what to say.
Listening takes effort and concentration.
One missionary shared the following true experience (the names have been changed):
My companion and I were teaching the Sanchez family.
It was hot and the children were making a lot of noise.
I asked Sister Sanchez about her reading in the Book of Mormon.
As she began to explain, I noticed that their son had grabbed my companion’s notebook and was running around the room waving it in the air.
Although I was looking at Sister Sanchez, my mind was elsewhere.
I thought to myself, “It’s so hot, and I wish their little boy would settle down.
This just isn’t going to work.” As my mind wandered, I noticed that Sister Sanchez was struggling to talk.
A subtle impression came into my mind to listen.
I fought to tune out the heat and the noise.
I carefully watched her face as she spoke.
She looked down at the ground, then back up at my companion and me.
Her husband was hopelessly trying to quiet the children.
There was a pause, and then with trembling in her voice she said, “I did what you asked.
I read those chapters you wanted me to, and I prayed.” Again she paused and looked down.
She glanced at her children, then her eyes met mine.
“I got an answer,” she said with a smile and with tear-filled eyes.
“It’s true, I know it’s true.” The Spirit filled the room.
With a heart full of gratitude that I had listened, I smiled and said, “Yes, it is.”

When I talk with others, I think of similar experiences that I can share instead of listening carefully.
When others tell me about their feelings, I try to put myself in their shoes to see how I would feel.
When I teach people, I am worried about what I am going to say or teach next.
I get frustrated when people want to talk a lot.
I struggle to follow or understand what others are trying to tell me.
My mind often wanders while my companion is teaching.
I get upset if someone is talking to me and others cut in or distract my attention.
I receive spiritual promptings to say or do something, but I ignore them.
Determine what you can do to improve your ability to listen.

Develop a Good Relationship with the People You Teach
To avoid embarrassment, some people will answer questions the way they think you want them to answer rather than share true feelings.
Seek to develop a relationship that allows them to be comfortable sharing their true feelings with you.
