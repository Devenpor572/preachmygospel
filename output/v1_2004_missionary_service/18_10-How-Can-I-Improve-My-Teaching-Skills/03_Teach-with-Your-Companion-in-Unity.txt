Teach with Your Companion in Unity
The Lord has commanded, “Ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two” ( Doctrine and Covenants 42:6 ).
Your teaching will be more powerful and interesting if you and your companion work together in unity.
As you plan and study each day, discuss how you will teach so that you can be united and teach with one voice.
Your teaching will be more powerful if you and your companion alternate giving brief portions of the lesson.
Avoid falling into a routine when presenting the message.
Support your companion by offering a second witness to the truths of which he or she has testified.
Follow your impressions when the Spirit prompts you to say something.
As companions, be ready to yield to each other so that you do not hinder the guidance of the Spirit.
When you speak, maintain eye contact with the person.
When you are not speaking, pray for your companion and carefully observe the person’s responses.
