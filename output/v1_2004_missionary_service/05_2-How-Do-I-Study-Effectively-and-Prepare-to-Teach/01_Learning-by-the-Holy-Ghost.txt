Learning by the Holy Ghost
Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost.
Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn.
He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others.
Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase.
Your desire to repent and improve will grow.
This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end.
Successful gospel study requires desire and action.
“For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” ( 1 Nephi 10:19 ).
Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” ( Enos 1:3 ), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding.
Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see Jacob 4:8 ).
To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.
But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” ( Doctrine and Covenants 9:7–8 ).
As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching.
