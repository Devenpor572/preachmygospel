Faith in Jesus Christ
For faith to lead to salvation, you must center it in Jesus Christ (see Acts 4:10–12 ; Mosiah 3:17 ; Moroni 7:24–26 ).
When you have faith in Christ, you trust in Him as the Only Begotten Son of God.
You are confident that as you repent, you will be forgiven of your sins through His atoning sacrifice and be sanctified by the Holy Ghost (see 3 Nephi 27:16, 20 ).
Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge.
Rather, it is an assurance from the Spirit of things you do not see but that are true.
(See Alma 32:21 .)
You express your faith through action.
These actions include following the Savior’s teachings and example.
They include serving others and helping them choose to follow Christ.
You also express your faith through diligence, repentance, and love.
Faith is a principle of power.
As you exercise faith in Jesus Christ, you will be blessed with His power suited to your circumstance.
You will be able to experience miracles according to the Lord’s will.
(See Jacob 4:4–7 ; Moroni 7:33 ; 10:7 .)
Your faith in Jesus Christ will grow as you become better acquainted with Him and His teachings.
It will increase as you search the scriptures, pray sincerely, and obey the commandments.
Doubt and sin undermine faith.
“Faith is not only a feeling; it is a decision.
With prayer, study, obedience, and covenants, we build and fortify our faith.
Our conviction of the Savior and His latter-day work becomes the powerful lens through which we judge all else.
Then, as we find ourselves in the crucible of life, … we have the strength to take the right course” (Neil L.
Andersen, “ It’s True, Isn’t It?
Then What Else Matters?
” Ensign or Liahona , May 2007, 74).
