Virtue
“We believe in being … virtuous,” the Articles of Faith state ( 1:13 ).
Virtue is a pattern of thought and behavior based on high moral standards.
It is fidelity to God and others.
An essential part of virtue is striving to be clean and pure spiritually and physically.
Virtue originates in your thoughts and desires.
“Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly,” the Lord said ( Doctrine and Covenants 121:45 ).
Focus on righteous, uplifting thoughts.
Put unworthy thoughts out of your mind rather than dwell on them.
Your mind is like a stage in a theater.
If you allow unwholesome thoughts to linger on the stage of your mind, you are more likely to sin.
If you actively fill your mind with wholesome things, you are more likely to embrace what is virtuous and shun what is evil.
Be wise about what you allow to enter and remain on the stage of your mind.
As you endeavor to live virtuously, your “confidence [will] wax strong in the presence of God; and … the Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion” ( Doctrine and Covenants 121:45–46 ).
