Integrity
Integrity flows from the first great commandment to love God (see Matthew 22:37 ).
Because you love God, you are true to Him at all times.
Like the sons of Helaman, you “walk uprightly before him” ( Alma 53:21 ).
When you have integrity, you understand that there is right and wrong and that there is absolute truth—God’s truth.
You use your agency to choose according to God’s truth, and you promptly repent when you do not.
What you choose to think—and what you do when you believe no one is watching—is a strong measure of your integrity.
Integrity means you do not lower your standards or behavior so you can impress or be accepted by others.
You do what is right even when others scoff at your desire to be true to God (see 1 Nephi 8:24–28 ).
You live with honor in all environments, including how you represent yourself online.
When you have integrity, you keep your covenants with God as well as your righteous commitments to others.
Integrity includes being honest with God, yourself, your leaders, and others.
You do not lie, steal, cheat, or deceive.
When you do something wrong, you accept responsibility and repent instead of trying to justify or rationalize it.
As you live with integrity, you will have inner peace and self-respect.
The Lord and others will trust you.
