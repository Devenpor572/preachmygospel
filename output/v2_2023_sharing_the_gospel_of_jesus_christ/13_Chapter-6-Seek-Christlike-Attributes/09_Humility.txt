Humility
Humility is willingness to submit to the will of the Lord.
It is willingness to give Him the honor for what is accomplished.
It is being teachable (see Doctrine and Covenants 136:32 ).
Humility includes gratitude for God’s blessings and acknowledgment of your constant need for His help.
He helps those who are humble.
Humility is a sign of spiritual strength, not of weakness.
Humility is a vital catalyst for spiritual growth (see Ether 12:27 ).
When you humbly trust the Lord, you can have the assurance that His commandments are for your good.
You are confident that you can do whatever He requires of you if you rely on Him.
You are also willing to trust His servants and follow their counsel.
Humility will help you be obedient, work hard, and serve.
The opposite of humility is pride.
To be prideful means to put greater trust in oneself than in God.
It also means to put the things of the world above the things of God.
Pride is competitive; those who are prideful seek to have more and presume they are better than others.
Pride is a great stumbling block.
