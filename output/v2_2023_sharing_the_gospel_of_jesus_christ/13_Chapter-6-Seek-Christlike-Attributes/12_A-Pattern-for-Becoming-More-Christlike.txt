A Pattern for Becoming More Christlike
The following pattern can help you develop and receive the attributes described in this chapter and other attributes described in the scriptures:
Identify the attribute you want to seek.
Write a description of the attribute.
List and study passages of scripture that show examples of the attribute or that teach about it.
Record your feelings and impressions.
Set goals and make plans to progress in the attribute.
Pray for God to help you develop and receive the attribute.
Evaluate your progress periodically.
“The Lord blesses those who want to improve, who accept the need for commandments and try to keep them, who cherish Christlike virtues and strive to the best of their ability to acquire them.
If you stumble in that pursuit, so does everyone; the Savior is there to help you keep going.
… Soon enough you will have the success you seek” (Jeffrey R.
Holland, “ Tomorrow the Lord Will Do Wonders among You ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 126).
Personal Study

How can you better represent the Savior as one of His disciples?
Why is it important for people to associate your name with the Savior’s in a positive way?
Write your thoughts in your study journal.

Strive to be a Christlike missionary, not just follow a missionary routine.
Learning to be like Christ is a lifelong pursuit.
You follow Christ’s example and receive His attributes one action and decision at a time.
Becoming Christlike requires exercising faith, repenting, keeping covenants, receiving help from the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
