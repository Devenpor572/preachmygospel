Teach from Your Heart as Guided by the Spirit
Speaking to all elders and sisters, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated:
“Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught.
It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation.
The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit.
He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms.
He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the [person].
Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words, he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings.”
The Role of Memorization
Commit to memory the sequence of the teachings in each lesson.
Do not memorize lessons word for word.
If you are learning a second language, focus your language study on preparing to teach the lessons.
Memorize vocabulary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lessons.
Memorizing the outlines in lessons 1–3 can also be helpful.
What you memorize should become personally meaningful to you.
Consider memorizing key doctrinal scriptures to use in your teaching and your personal life.
Great power can come from memorizing scriptures.
These scriptures can strengthen you and give you inspiration and comfort.
They can prompt you to change.
When you memorize scriptures, the Spirit can bring them to your mind when you need them.
