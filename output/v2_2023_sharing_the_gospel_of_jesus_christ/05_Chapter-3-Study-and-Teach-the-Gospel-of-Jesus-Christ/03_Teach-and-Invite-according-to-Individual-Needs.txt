Teach and Invite according to Individual Needs
You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way helps people fully prepare for baptism and confirmation.
Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the person you are teaching and the guidance of the Spirit.
For example, when teaching people who do not have a Christian background, you might begin by helping them develop a greater connection with Heavenly Father and an understanding of His plan (see “ Teaching People Who Do Not Have a Christian Background ” in chapter 10).
Let the Spirit guide you in what invitations to extend and when to extend them.
The right invitation at the right time can prompt people to do things that will build their faith.
These actions can lead to a mighty change of heart (see Mosiah 5:2 ; Alma 5:12–14 ).
Teach lessons that are simple, clear, and brief.
Typically, a teaching visit should not be longer than 30 minutes, and you can teach a person in as few as 5 minutes.
You will usually need multiple meetings to teach the principles in one lesson.
People will often better understand your message if you teach short lessons, teach frequently, and teach small portions of material.
