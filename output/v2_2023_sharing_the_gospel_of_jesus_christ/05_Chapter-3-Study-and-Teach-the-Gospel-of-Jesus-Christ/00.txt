The lessons in this chapter contain the essential doctrine, principles, and commandments of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
These lessons are what the living prophets and apostles have instructed you to learn and teach.
They are provided here so you can help others clearly understand the doctrine of Christ.
The first section in this chapter is the baptismal invitation.
The rest of the chapter consists of the following four lessons:
The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
Heavenly Father’s Plan of Salvation
The Gospel of Jesus Christ
Becoming Lifelong Disciples of Jesus Christ
Study the scriptures and treasure up the doctrine in each lesson.
As you do, the Spirit will bear witness of the truths you study.
He will help you know what to say and do to help others receive a witness of the truth.
(See
Doctrine and Covenants 84:85
.)
People will come to know the Savior more fully as they do what He has invited them to do.
Extend invitations in each lesson, and help people keep their commitments.
As people keep commitments, they begin to live the gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare to make covenants with God.
Teach all the lessons before and after baptism.
Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching the lessons both times.
Ward missionaries or other members participate when possible.
