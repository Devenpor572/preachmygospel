Dear Fellow Missionary:
We
congratulate you on the great opportunity you have to be a missionary 
for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
There is no more 
compelling or important work than the gathering of Israel.
Preach My Gospel
is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature 
missionary.
It is also intended to help you be a more effective teacher.
We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion study.
We 
also encourage you to use it in your district council meetings and zone 
conferences.
Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrine and 
principles.
We invite you 
to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in 
His glorious work.
Every missionary has an important role in helping the
Lord in His work “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of 
man” (
Moses 1:39
).
The
Lord will bless you as you humbly dedicate yourself to serving Him.
May
you find great joy and happiness as you labor among Heavenly Father’s 
children.
The First Presidency
