Our Covenant to Keep the Commandments of God
Note: There are many ways to teach the commandments in this section.
For example, you might teach them in a few visits.
Or you could teach some of them as part of the first three lessons.
When teaching the commandments, be sure to connect them to the baptismal covenant and the plan of salvation.
When we are baptized, we covenant with God that we will “keep his commandments” ( Mosiah 18:10 ; Alma 7:15 ).
God has given us commandments because He loves us.
He wants the best for us, both now and in eternity.
As our Heavenly Father, He knows what we need for our spiritual and physical well-being.
He also knows what will bring us the greatest happiness.
Each commandment is a divine gift, given to guide our decisions, protect us, and help us grow.
One reason we came to earth is to learn and grow through using our agency wisely (see Abraham 3:25 ).
Choosing to obey God’s commandments—and to repent when we fall short—helps us navigate this often challenging mortal journey.
The commandments of God are a source of strength and blessings (see Doctrine and Covenants 82:8–9 ).
By keeping the commandments, we learn that they are not burdensome rules that restrict our freedom.
True freedom comes from obeying the commandments.
Obedience is a source of strength that brings us light and knowledge through the Holy Ghost.
It brings us greater happiness and helps us reach our divine potential as children of God.
God promises to bless us as we keep His commandments.
Some blessings are specific to certain commandments.
His ultimate blessings are peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come.
(See Mosiah 2:41 ; Alma 7:16 ; Doctrine and Covenants 14:7 ; 59:23 ; 93:28 ; 130:20–21 .)
God’s blessings are both spiritual and temporal.
At times, we need to be patient in waiting for them, trusting that they will come according to His will and timing (see Mosiah 7:33 ; Doctrine and Covenants 88:68 ).
To discern some blessings, we need to be spiritually attentive and observant.
This is especially true of blessings that come in simple and seemingly ordinary ways.
Some blessings might be evident only in hindsight.
Others might not come until after this life.
Regardless of the timing or nature of God’s blessings, we can be assured that they will come as we strive to live the gospel of Jesus Christ (see Doctrine and Covenants 82:10 ).
God loves all His children perfectly.
He is patient with our weakness, and He is forgiving when we repent.
The Two Great Commandments
When Jesus was asked, “Which is the great commandment?” He answered, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.”
Jesus then said the second great commandment is like unto the first: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” ( Matthew 22:36–39 ).
“There is none other commandment greater than these” ( Mark 12:31 ).
As God’s spirit children, we have a vast capacity for love.
It is part of our spiritual heritage.
Living the two great commandments—to love God first and to love our neighbor—is a defining characteristic of disciples of Jesus Christ.
Love of God
There are many ways we can show our love for God.
We can keep His commandments (see John 14:15, 21 ).
We can put Him first in our lives, submitting our will to His.
We can center our desires, thoughts, and hearts on Him (see Alma 37:36 ).
We can live in gratitude for the blessings He has given us—and be generous in sharing those blessings (see Mosiah 2:21–24 ; 4:16–21 ).
Through prayer and service to others, we can express and deepen our love for Him.
Like other commandments, the commandment to love God is for our benefit.
What we love determines what we seek.
What we seek determines what we think and do.
And what we think and do determines who we are—and who we will become.
Love of Others
Loving others is an extension of our love for God.
The Savior taught us many ways to love others (see, for example, Luke 10:25–37 and Matthew 25:31–46 ).
We reach out and welcome them into our hearts and lives.
We love by serving—by giving of ourselves even in small ways.
We love others by using the gifts that God has given us to bless them.
Loving others includes being patient, kind, and honest.
It includes forgiving freely.
It means treating all people with respect.
When we love someone, we and that person are both blessed.
Our hearts grow, our lives become more meaningful, and our joy increases.
Blessings
The two great commandments—to love God and love our neighbor—are the foundation of all of God’s commandments (see Matthew 22:40 ).
When we love God first, and also love others, everything in our lives will move into its proper place.
This love will affect our perspective, the use of our time, the interests we pursue, and the order of our priorities.

Follow the Prophet
God calls prophets to be His representatives on earth.
Through His prophets, He reveals truth and provides guidance and warnings.
God called Joseph Smith to be the first prophet of the latter days (see lesson 1 ).
Successors to Joseph Smith have likewise been called of God to lead His Church, including the prophet who leads it today.
We should gain a conviction of the divine calling of the living prophet and follow his teachings.
The teachings of the living prophets and apostles provide an anchor of eternal truth in a world of shifting values.
As we follow God’s prophets, the confusion and strife of the world will not overwhelm us.
We will find greater happiness in this life and receive guidance for this part of our eternal journey.

Keep the Ten Commandments
God revealed the Ten Commandments to an ancient prophet named Moses to guide his people.
These commandments apply just as much in our day.
They teach us to worship and show reverence for God.
They also teach us how to treat one another.
“Thou shalt have no other gods before me” ( Exodus 20:3 ).
Other “gods” can include many things, such as possessions, power, or prominence.
“Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” ( Exodus 20:4 ).
“Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain” ( Exodus 20:7 ).
“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” ( Exodus 20:8 ).
“Honour thy father and thy mother” ( Exodus 20:12 ).
“Thou shalt not kill” ( Exodus 20:13 ).
“Thou shalt not commit adultery” ( Exodus 20:14 ).
“Thou shalt not steal” ( Exodus 20:15 ).
“Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” ( Exodus 20:16 ).
“Thou shalt not covet” ( Exodus 20:17 ).
Teaching Insight: No Other Gods before Me
People in many cultures pay respect to objects that remind them of Deity or ancestors.
Sometimes those objects, such as statues, religious emblems, or small shrines, might also be the focus of their worship.
Help those you teach to focus their faith and worship on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.

Live the Law of Chastity
The law of chastity is a vital part of God’s plan for our salvation and exaltation.
Sexual intimacy between husband and wife is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love within marriage.
This intimacy and the power to create human life are intended to be beautiful and sacred.
God’s law of chastity is abstinence from sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between one man and one woman.
This law also means having complete fidelity and loyalty to a person’s spouse after marriage.
To help us keep the law of chastity, prophets have admonished us to be clean in our thoughts and words.
We should avoid pornography in any form.
In keeping with the law of chastity, we should be modest in our behavior and appearance.
Baptismal candidates are to live the law of chastity.
Repentance and Forgiveness
In God’s sight, breaking the law of chastity is very serious (see Exodus 20:14 ; Ephesians 5:3 ).
It misuses the sacred power that He has given to create life.
But He continues to love us even if we have broken this law.
He invites us to repent and become clean through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
The despair of sin can be replaced with the sweet peace of God’s forgiveness (see Doctrine and Covenants 58:42–43 ).
Blessings
God has given the law of chastity to bless us and the spirit children He sends to earth.
Obeying this law is essential to personal peace and to having love, trust, and unity in our family relationships.
As we live the law of chastity, we will be protected from the spiritual harm that comes from sexual intimacy outside of marriage.
We will also avoid the emotional and physical problems that often accompany such relations.
We will grow in our confidence before God (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:45 ).
We will be more open to the influence of the Holy Ghost.
We will be better prepared to make sacred covenants in the temple that unite our families for eternity.
Couples Living Together
A couple living together outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman may not be baptized until they live the law of chastity.
This means no longer living together—whether as a heterosexual couple or a same-sex couple—or, for a man and a woman, it means getting married.
It also includes exercising faith unto repentance as described in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 .
Marriage between a man and a woman is an essential part of God’s plan.
The invitation to live the law of chastity may pose very difficult challenges to some people you are teaching.
Be prayerful and sensitive to each person’s situation.
Follow the promptings of the Spirit when teaching.
Use caution and do not discuss specific details.
As needed, seek counsel from your mission president for specific situations.

Keep the Law of Tithing
A great privilege of membership in the Church is the opportunity to pay tithing.
As we tithe, we help further God’s work and bless His children.
The law of tithing has origins in Old Testament times.
For example, the prophet Abraham paid tithes of all he possessed (see Alma 13:15 ; Genesis 14:18–20 ).
The word tithe literally means one-tenth.
As we tithe, we donate one-tenth of our income to the Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 119:3–4 ; interest is understood to mean income).
All that we have is a gift from God.
When we pay tithing, we show gratitude to Him by returning a portion of what He has given us.
Paying tithing is an expression of faith.
It is also a way to honor God.
Jesus taught that we should “seek … first the kingdom of God” ( Matthew 6:33 ), and tithing is a way of doing that.
Use of Tithing Funds
Tithing funds are sacred.
We give our tithing to a member of the bishopric, or in many areas we can pay online.
When the bishopric receives tithing, they transmit it to Church headquarters.
A council composed of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Presiding Bishopric determines how to use tithing funds in God’s work (see Doctrine and Covenants 120:1 ).
These uses include:
Building and maintaining temples and meetinghouses.
Translating and publishing scriptures.
Supporting the activities and operations of local Church congregations.
Supporting missionary work throughout the world.
Supporting family history work.
Funding schools and education.
Tithing is not used to pay local Church leaders.
They serve voluntarily without any payment.
Blessings
When we pay tithing, God promises blessings that are far greater than what we give.
He will “open … the windows of heaven, and pour … out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it” ( Malachi 3:10 ; see verses 7–12 ).
These blessings may be both spiritual and temporal.

Obey the Word of Wisdom
The Lord’s Law of Health
Our bodies are sacred gifts from God.
We each need a physical body to become more like Him.
Our bodies are so important that the scriptures compare them to temples (see 1 Corinthians 6:19–20 ).
The Lord wants us to treat our bodies with respect.
To help us do this, He revealed a law of health called the Word of Wisdom.
This revelation teaches us about eating healthy foods and not using substances that harm our bodies—specifically alcohol, tobacco, and hot drinks (meaning tea and coffee).
In the spirit of the Word of Wisdom, modern prophets have warned against using other substances that are harmful, illegal, or addictive.
Prophets have also warned against abusing prescription drugs.
(Your mission president will answer questions about whether other substances in your geographic area should not be used.)
Blessings
The Lord provided the Word of Wisdom for our physical and spiritual well-being.
He promises great blessings as we keep this commandment.
These blessings include health, wisdom, treasures of knowledge, and protection (see Doctrine and Covenants 89:18–21 ).
Obeying the Word of Wisdom will help us be more receptive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost.
Although we all experience health challenges, obeying this law will help us be healthier in body, mind, and spirit.
Baptismal candidates are to obey the Word of Wisdom.
For guidance about helping people who are struggling with addictions, see chapter 10 .

Keep the Sabbath Day Holy
A Day for Rest and Worship
The Sabbath is a holy day that God has set apart for us each week to rest from our daily labors and worship Him.
One of the Ten Commandments given to Moses is to “remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” ( Exodus 20:8 ; see also verses 9–11 ).
In a modern revelation, the Lord reaffirmed that the Sabbath “is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High” ( Doctrine and Covenants 59:10 ).
He also said the Sabbath should be a day of rejoicing, prayer, and thanksgiving (see verses 14–15 ).
As part of our Sabbath worship, we attend sacrament meeting each week.
In this meeting, we worship God and partake of the sacrament to remember Jesus Christ and His Atonement.
When we partake of the sacrament, we renew our covenants with God and show that we are willing to repent of our sins.
The ordinance of the sacrament is the center of our Sabbath-day observance.
At church we also participate in classes in which we learn more about the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Our faith grows as we study the scriptures together.
Our love grows as we serve and strengthen each other.
In addition to resting from our labors on the Sabbath, we should refrain from shopping and other activities that would make it feel like a common day.
We set aside the activities of the world and focus our thoughts and actions on spiritual matters.
A Day for Doing Good
Doing good on the Sabbath day is at least as important as what we refrain from doing to keep it holy.
We learn the gospel, strengthen faith, build relationships, give service, and participate in other uplifting activities with family and friends.
Blessings
Keeping the Sabbath day holy is an expression of our devotion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
As we make our Sabbath activities compatible with God’s intent for the day, we will feel joy and peace.
We will be spiritually nourished and physically refreshed.
We will also feel closer to God and deepen our relationship with our Savior.
We will more fully keep ourselves “unspotted from the world” ( Doctrine and Covenants 59:9 ).
The Sabbath will become “a delight” ( Isaiah 58:13 ; see also verse 14 ).
