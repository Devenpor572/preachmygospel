Teaching This Lesson
Baptism is a joyous ordinance of hope.
When we are baptized, we show our desire to follow God and enter the path leading to eternal life.
We also show our commitment to becoming lifelong disciples of Jesus Christ.
This lesson is organized according to the covenants we make at baptism.
It includes the following main sections, each of which has subsections:
Our Covenant to Be Willing to Take upon Us the Name of Jesus Christ
Our Covenant to Keep the Commandments of God
Our Covenant to Serve God and Others
Our Covenant to Endure to the End
Help people understand that the principles and commandments you teach are part of the covenant they will make at baptism.
Show them how each part of this lesson will help them “come unto Christ … and partake of his salvation” ( Omni 1:26 ; see also 1 Nephi 15:14 ).

Consider the needs of the people you are teaching, and seek the guidance of the Spirit.
You have the flexibility to teach according to what will best help people prepare for baptism and confirmation.
