Our Covenant to Endure to the End
When we are baptized, we covenant with God to “endure to the end” in living the gospel of Jesus Christ ( 2 Nephi 31:20 ; see also Mosiah 18:13 ).
We strive to be lifelong disciples of Jesus Christ.
The Book of Mormon prophet Nephi described baptism as the gate by which we enter the gospel path (see 2 Nephi 31:17 ).
After baptism, we continue to “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ” ( 2 Nephi 31:20 ).
As we “press forward” on the path of discipleship, we prepare to go to the temple.
There we will make covenants with God as we receive temple ordinances.
In the temple, we will be endowed with power and can be sealed as families for eternity.
Keeping the covenants we make in the temple will open the door to every spiritual privilege and blessing that God has for us.
As we continue faithfully along the gospel path, we will eventually receive God’s greatest gift—the gift of eternal life (see 2 Nephi 31:20 ; Doctrine and Covenants 14:7 ).
The following sections explain some aspects of what God has provided to help us endure to the end of our mortal journey—and find joy in it.
Priesthood and Church Organizations
The priesthood is the authority and power of God.
Through the priesthood, Heavenly Father accomplishes His work “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life” of His children ( Moses 1:39 ).
God grants authority and power to His sons and daughters on earth to help carry out this work.
The priesthood blesses all of us.
Ordinances such as baptism and the sacrament are received through those who hold priesthood offices.
We also receive blessings of healing, comfort, and counsel.
The Priesthood and Church Leadership and Callings
The Church is led by Jesus Christ through prophets and apostles.
These leaders are called of God, ordained, and given priesthood authority to act in the Savior’s name.
Anciently, Christ gave His Apostles this same priesthood authority, which allowed them to lead His Church after He ascended to heaven.
Eventually that authority was lost when people rejected the gospel and the Apostles died.
Heavenly messengers restored the priesthood in 1829 through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the Lord again established His Church with apostles and prophets.
(See lesson 1 .)
At the local level, bishops and stake presidents have priesthood authority to lead Church congregations.
When men and women are called and set apart to serve in the Church, they are given authority from God to act in that calling.
This authority is given to missionaries, leaders, teachers, and others until they are released from their callings.
It is delegated under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys.
Priesthood authority can be used only in righteousness (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:34–46 ).
This authority is a sacred trust to represent the Savior and act in His name.
It is always intended to bless and serve others.
Aaronic Priesthood and Melchizedek Priesthood
In the Church, the priesthood includes the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood.
Under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys, the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood are conferred on worthy male Church members.
After the appropriate priesthood is conferred, the person is ordained to an office in that priesthood, such as deacon or elder.
He must be ordained by someone who has the necessary authority.
When a man or young man receives the priesthood, he makes a covenant with God to fulfill sacred duties, serve others, and help build up the Church.
Young men may receive the Aaronic Priesthood and be ordained deacons beginning in January of the year they turn 12.
They may be ordained teachers in the year they turn 14 and priests in the year they turn 16.
Male converts who are of age may receive the Aaronic Priesthood soon after baptism and confirmation.
Aaronic Priesthood holders administer ordinances such as the sacrament and baptism.
After serving for a time as a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood, a worthy man who is at least 18 may receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained an elder.
Men who receive the Melchizedek Priesthood can perform priesthood ordinances such as giving blessings of healing and comfort to family members and others.
See General Handbook , 38.2.9.1 , for information about new members receiving the priesthood.
Quorums and Church Organizations
Priesthood Quorums.
A quorum is an organized group of priesthood holders.
Each ward has an elders quorum for adult men.
Deacons, teachers, and priests quorums are for young men.
Relief Society.
The Relief Society includes women ages 18 and over.
Members of Relief Society strengthen families, individuals, and the community.
Young Women.
Young women join the Young Women organization beginning in January of the year they turn 12.
Primary.
Children ages 3 to 11 are part of the Primary organization.
Sunday School.
All adults and youth attend Sunday School, where they meet to study the scriptures together.
For more information about the priesthood, see General Handbook , chapter 3 .
For more information about priesthood quorums and Church organizations, see General Handbook , chapters 8–13 .

Marriage and Families
Marriage
Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.
It is central to His plan for the eternal progress of His children.
The union of a husband and wife in marriage should be their most cherished earthly relationship.
They have a sacred responsibility to be loyal to each other and faithful to their marriage covenant.
A husband and wife are equal in God’s eyes.
One should not dominate the other.
Their decisions should be made in unity and love, with full participation of both.
As a husband and wife love each other and work together, their marriage can be the source of their greatest happiness.
They can help each other and their children progress toward eternal life.
The Family
Like marriage, the family is ordained of God and is central to His plan for our eternal happiness.
Our families are most likely to be happy when we live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Parents teach their children the gospel of Jesus Christ and set an example in living it.
Families provide opportunities for us to love and serve each other.
Parents should make their family their highest priority.
It is a sacred privilege and responsibility for parents to care for the children they are able to bear or adopt.
All families have challenges.
As we seek God’s support and keep His commandments, family challenges can help us learn and grow.
Sometimes these challenges help us learn to repent and forgive.
Church leaders have encouraged members to hold a weekly home evening.
Parents use this time to teach their children the gospel, strengthen family relationships, and have fun together.
Church leaders have also issued a proclamation that teaches important truths about the family (see “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org).
Other ways to strengthen the family include family prayer, scripture study, and worshipping together at church.
We can also research family history, gather family stories, and serve others.
Many people have limited opportunities for marriage or for loving family relationships.
Many have experienced divorce and other difficult family circumstances.
However, the gospel blesses us individually regardless of our family circumstance.
And as we are faithful, God will provide a way for us to have the blessings of loving families, whether in this life or in the life to come.

Temple and Family History Work for Deceased Ancestors
Heavenly Father loves all His children and desires their salvation and exaltation.
Yet billions of people have died without hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ or receiving the saving ordinances of the gospel.
These ordinances include baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination for men, the temple endowment, and eternal marriage.
Through His grace and mercy, the Lord has provided another way for these people to receive the gospel and its ordinances.
In the spirit world, the gospel is preached to those who have died without receiving it (see Doctrine and Covenants 138 ).
In temples, we can perform the ordinances on behalf of our deceased ancestors and others.
These deceased people in the spirit world can then accept or reject the gospel and the ordinances performed for them.
Before we can perform these ordinances, we need to identify our ancestors who have not received them.
Identifying our family members so they can receive ordinances is a central purpose of our family history work.
When we find information about them, we add it to the Church’s database at FamilySearch.org .
Then we (or others) can perform proxy ordinances for them in the temple.
As we identify our ancestors and perform ordinances for them, our families may become united for eternity.
Family History Work and Temple Attendance
Introduce new members and those you are teaching to the ward temple and family history leader (or to another member who is familiar with temple and family history work).
This leader can help people identify their deceased relatives who need temple ordinances.
Use the weekly coordination meeting to plan how to help new members begin doing family history and temple work.
New members and other members may receive from their bishop a temple recommend to perform proxy baptisms and confirmations for their deceased ancestors and others.
A member is eligible to receive this recommend beginning in January of the year he or she turns 12.
Males also need to hold the Aaronic Priesthood to be eligible.
Encourage new members to obtain a recommend as soon as is reasonable.
If a temple is nearby, go with new members if possible.
Participate with them in temple ordinances.

Temples, the Endowment, Eternal Marriage, and Eternal Families
Temples
The temple is the house of the Lord.
It is a holy place where we can make covenants with God as we receive His sacred ordinances.
As we keep these covenants, we will have the power of godliness manifest in our lives (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–22 ; 109:22–23 ).
The Endowment
One of the ordinances we receive in the temple is called the endowment.
The word endowment means “a gift.” This gift of knowledge and power comes from God.
During the endowment, we make covenants with God that bind us to Him and His Son, Jesus Christ (see chapter 1 ).
Adults may be eligible to receive their own temple endowment after at least one year of Church membership.
For more information about the endowment, see General Handbook , 27.2 .
Eternal Marriage and Eternal Families
God’s plan of happiness enables family relationships to endure beyond the grave.
In the temple we can be married for time and eternity.
This makes it possible for families to be together forever.
After married couples have received their temple endowment, they may be sealed or married for eternity.
Their children may be sealed to them.
A husband and wife who have been sealed in the temple must keep the covenants they have made to receive the blessings of eternal marriage.
Sensitivity When Teaching about Eternal Families
Some people may have family circumstances that make it unappealing for them to be together forever.
Others may not have a spouse or children in this life.
Remind those you are teaching that God’s plan is a plan of happiness.
Help them see that living the gospel now can prepare them for an eternal family in the future, even if that comes after this life.
Regardless of a person’s family or marital situation, adults should prepare to receive their own temple endowment.
Receiving their endowment will be a great strength to them.
Also help them see that they have an opportunity to unite deceased ancestors through temple work.
