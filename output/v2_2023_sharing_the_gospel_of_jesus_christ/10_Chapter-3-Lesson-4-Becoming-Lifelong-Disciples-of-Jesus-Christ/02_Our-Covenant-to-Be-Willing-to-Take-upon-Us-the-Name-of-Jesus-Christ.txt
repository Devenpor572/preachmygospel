Our Covenant to Be Willing to Take upon Us the Name of Jesus Christ
When we are baptized, we covenant to follow Jesus Christ “with full purpose of heart.” We also witness that we “are willing to take upon [us] the name of Christ” ( 2 Nephi 31:13 ; see also Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 ).
Taking upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ means that we remember Him and strive to live as His lifelong disciples.
We let His light shine through us to others.
We see ourselves as His and put Him first in our lives.
The following sections describe two ways we remember and follow Jesus Christ.
Pray Often
Prayer can be a simple conversation with Heavenly Father that comes from the heart.
In prayer, we speak with Him openly and honestly.
We express love for Him and gratitude for our blessings.
We also ask for help, protection, and direction.
As we close our prayers, we should take time to pause and listen.
Jesus taught, “Ye must always pray unto the Father in my name ” ( 3 Nephi 18:19 , emphasis added; see also Moses 5:8 ).
As we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, we remember both Him and Heavenly Father.
Jesus set the example for us to follow as we pray.
We can learn much about prayer by studying the Savior’s prayers in the scriptures (see Matthew 6:9–13 ; John 17 ).
Our prayers can include the following parts:
Begin by addressing Heavenly Father.
Express the feelings of our heart, such as gratitude for blessings we have received.
Ask questions, seek guidance, and ask for blessings.
End by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.”
The scriptures admonish us to pray in the morning and in the evening.
However, we can pray at any time and in any setting.
For our personal and family prayers, it can be meaningful to kneel when we pray.
We should always have a prayer in our hearts.
(See Alma 34:27 ; 37:36–37 ; 3 Nephi 17:13 ; 19:16 .)
Our prayers should be thoughtful and from the heart.
When we pray, we should avoid saying the same things in the same ways.
We pray with faith, sincerity, and real intent to act on the answers we receive.
As we do this, God will guide us and help us make good decisions.
We will feel closer to Him.
He will grant us understanding and truth.
He will bless us with comfort, peace, and strength.

Study the Scriptures
Nephi taught, “Feast upon the words of Christ; for [they] will tell you all things what ye should do” ( 2 Nephi 32:3 ; see also 31:20 ).
Studying the scriptures is an essential way to remember and follow Jesus Christ.
In the scriptures we learn of His life, ministry, and teachings.
We also learn of His promises.
As we read the scriptures, we experience His love.
Our souls expand, our faith in Him increases, and our minds are enlightened.
Our testimonies of His divine mission become stronger.
We remember and follow Jesus as we apply His words in our lives.
We should study the scriptures daily, especially the Book of Mormon.
The scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.
These are also called the “standard works.”
