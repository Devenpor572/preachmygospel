Seek the Guidance of the Holy Ghost
The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of the greatest gifts that God has given His children.
It is vital in your work as a missionary.
You need the guiding, revelatory power of the Holy Ghost as you help people be baptized, confirmed, and converted.
Having the guidance of the Holy Ghost in your life requires spiritual work.
This work includes fervent prayer and consistent scripture study.
It also includes keeping your covenants and God’s commandments (see Mosiah 18:8–10, 13 ).
It includes worthily partaking of the sacrament each week (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ).
You face different needs and circumstances every day.
Promptings from the Spirit will help you know what to do and say.
As you seek and act on these promptings, the Holy Ghost will magnify your abilities and service to far exceed what you can do on your own.
He will help you in every aspect of your missionary service and your personal life.
(See 2 Nephi 32:2–5 ; Alma 17:3 ; Helaman 5:17–19 ; Doctrine and Covenants 43:15–16 ; 84:85 .)
“In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost” (Russell M.
Nelson, “ Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 96).
