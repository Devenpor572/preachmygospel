Learn to Recognize the Promptings of the Spirit
It is important for you and the people you teach to learn to recognize communications from the Spirit.
The Spirit usually communicates quietly, through your feelings, mind, and heart.
The prophet Elijah found that the voice of the Lord was not in the wind, the earthquake, or the fire—but was “a still small voice” ( 1 Kings 19:12 ).
It is “not a voice of thunder,” but rather “a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper,” and yet it can “pierce even to the very soul” ( Helaman 5:30 ).
Communications from the Spirit can feel different to different people.
Regardless of how these communications feel, the scriptures teach how to recognize them.
For example, the Spirit will edify you and lead you to do good.
He will enlighten your mind.
He will lead you to walk humbly and judge righteously.
(See Doctrine and Covenants 11:12–14 and the “Personal Study” box later in this section.)
In answer to the question “How do we recognize the promptings of the Spirit?” President Gordon B.
Hinckley read Moroni 7:13, 16–17 .
He then said:
“That’s the test, when all is said and done.
Does it persuade one to do good, to rise, to stand tall, to do the right thing, to be kind, to be generous?
Then it is of the Spirit of God.
…
“… If it invites to do good, it is of God.
If it inviteth to do evil, it is of the devil.
… And if you are doing the right thing and if you are living the right way, you will know in your heart what the Spirit is saying to you.
“You recognize the promptings of the Spirit by the fruits of the Spirit—that which enlighteneth, that which buildeth up, that which is positive and affirmative and uplifting and leads us to better thoughts and better words and better deeds is of the Spirit of God” ( Teachings of Gordon B.
Hinckley [1997], 260–61).
As you seek and follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost, your ability to discern and understand His promptings will develop over time (see 2 Nephi 28:30 ).
In some ways, becoming more attuned to the language of the Spirit is like learning another language.
It is a gradual process that requires diligent, patient effort.
Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost with full purpose of heart.
If you are preoccupied with other things, you may not sense the gentle whisperings of the Spirit.
Or He may wait to communicate until you seek His influence with a humble willingness to act on His promptings.
The voices in the world compete for your attention.
They can easily crowd out spiritual impressions unless you give place for the Spirit in your heart.
Remember this counsel from the Lord: “Be still, and know that I am God” ( Psalm 46:10 ; see also Doctrine and Covenants 101:16 ).
“God uses a variety of patterns to convey revelations to His sons and daughters, such as thoughts to the mind and feelings to the heart, dreams, … and inspiration.
Some revelations are received immediately and intensely; some are recognized gradually and subtly.
Receiving, recognizing, and responding to revelations from God are spiritual gifts for which we all should yearn and appropriately seek” (David A.
Bednar, “The Spirit of Revelation in the Work,” 2018 mission leadership seminar).
