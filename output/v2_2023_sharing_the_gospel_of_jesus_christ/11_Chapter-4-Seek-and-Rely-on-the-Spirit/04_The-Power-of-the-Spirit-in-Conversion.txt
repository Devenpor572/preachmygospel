The Power of the Spirit in Conversion
Conversion occurs through the power of the Holy Ghost.
Your role is to help bring the power of the Spirit into a person’s life.
Some ways you can do this are suggested below.
Seek to have the Spirit with you through prayer, searching the scriptures, and keeping your covenants.
Teach by the Spirit about the Savior and the message of the Restoration.
Follow the guidance of the Spirit in adapting your message to each person’s needs.
Testify that you know by the power of the Holy Ghost that what you teach is true.
As you testify, the Holy Ghost can bear witness to others.
Invite people to act, and support them in keeping their commitments.
As people keep commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly.
See chapter 11 .
Follow up by asking people about their experiences as they acted on an invitation.
Their faith will grow as they repent, obey the commandments, and keep their commitments.
Help them recognize the Spirit working with them.
President M.
Russell Ballard taught: “True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit.
When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed.
When individuals … feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases.
These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word [see Alma 32:27 ].
This is how we come to feel the gospel is true” (“ Now Is the Time ,” Ensign , Nov.
2000, 75).
