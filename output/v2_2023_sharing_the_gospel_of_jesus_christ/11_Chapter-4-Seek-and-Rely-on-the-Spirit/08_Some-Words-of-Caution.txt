Some Words of Caution
Confirm Your Impressions with Reliable Sources
As you pray for inspiration, compare your spiritual impressions with the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets.
Impressions from the Spirit will align with these sources.
Seek Revelation within Your Assignment
Be certain that the feelings you receive are consistent with your assignment.
Unless you are called by proper authority, impressions from the Spirit are not given for you to counsel or correct others.
For example, you will not receive revelation to tell a bishop what he should do in his calling.
Discern the True Influence of the Spirit
President Howard W.
Hunter counseled: “Let me offer a word of caution.
… I think if we are not careful … , we may begin to try to counterfeit the true influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and manipulative means.
I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit.
Certainly the Spirit of the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself” ( The Teachings of Howard W.
Hunter [1997], 184).
Do Not Try to Force Spiritual Things
Spiritual matters cannot be forced.
You can cultivate an attitude and an environment that invite the Spirit, and you can prepare yourself, but you cannot dictate how or when inspiration comes.
Be patient and trust that you will receive what you need when the time is right.
Keep Spiritual Experiences Sacred
As a missionary, you may be more aware of spiritual experiences than you have been earlier in your life.
These experiences are sacred and are generally for your own edification, instruction, or correction.
Many of these experiences are best kept private.
Share only when the Spirit indicates that you can bless other people by doing so (see Alma 12:9 ; Doctrine and Covenants 63:64 ; 84:73 ).
Use Your Own Best Judgment in Some Instances
Sometimes we want to be led by the Spirit in all things.
However, often the Lord wants us to act using our own best judgment (see Doctrine and Covenants 60:5 ; 61:22 ; 62:5 ).
President Dallin H.
Oaks taught:
“A desire to be led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for our personal choices.
Personal decision making is one of the sources of the growth we are meant to experience in mortality.
Persons who try to shift all decision making to the Lord and plead for revelation in every choice will soon find circumstances in which they pray for guidance and don’t receive it.
For example, this is likely to occur in those numerous circumstances in which the choices are trivial or either choice is acceptable.
“We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed within us.
Then we should pray for guidance and act upon it if we receive it.
If we do not receive guidance, we should act upon our best judgment.
Persons who persist in seeking revelatory guidance on subjects on which the Lord has not chosen to direct us may concoct an answer out of their own fantasy or bias, or they may even receive an answer through the medium of false revelation” (“ Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall ,” Ensign , Oct.
1994, 13–14).
