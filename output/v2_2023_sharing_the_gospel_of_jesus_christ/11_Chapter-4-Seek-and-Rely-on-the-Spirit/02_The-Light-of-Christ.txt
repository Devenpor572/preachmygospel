The Light of Christ
The Light of Christ “is given to every man, that he may know good from evil” ( Moroni 7:16 ; see verses 14–19 ; see also John 1:9 ).
The Light of Christ is enlightenment, knowledge, and influence that are given through Jesus Christ.
This influence is preliminary to receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.
It will guide those who are receptive to learn and live the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
