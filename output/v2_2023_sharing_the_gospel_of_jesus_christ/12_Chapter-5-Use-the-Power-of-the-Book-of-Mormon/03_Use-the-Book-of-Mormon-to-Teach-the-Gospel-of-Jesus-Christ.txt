Use the Book of Mormon to Teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ
The Prophet Joseph Smith said, “The Book of Mormon [is] the most correct of any book on earth” ( introduction to the Book of Mormon ).
It testifies of Christ and plainly teaches His doctrine (see 2 Nephi 31 ; 32:1–6 ; 3 Nephi 11:31–39 ; 27:13–22 ).
It teaches the fulness of His gospel.
The first principles and ordinances of the gospel as taught in the Book of Mormon are the way to an abundant life.
