The Book of Mormon and the Bible Support Each Other
The Lord said to “teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel” ( Doctrine and Covenants 42:12 ).
Latter-day Saints “believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly” ( Articles of Faith 1:8 ; see also 1 Nephi 13:29 ).
The Bible is sacred scripture.
The Book of Mormon is companion sacred scripture that contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
The Bible and Book of Mormon complement and enrich each other (see Ezekiel 37:16–17 ; 1 Nephi 13:40 ; Mormon 7:8–9 ).
Both volumes of scripture are compilations of teachings recorded by ancient prophets.
The Bible tells of God’s interactions with people in the Eastern Hemisphere for thousands of years.
The Book of Mormon tells of God’s interactions with people in the ancient Americas for more than a thousand years.
Most important, the Bible and Book of Mormon complement each other in witnessing of Jesus Christ.
The Bible provides the account of the Savior’s birth, mortal ministry, and Atonement—including His death and Resurrection.
The Book of Mormon includes prophecies of the Savior’s birth and mission, teachings about His Atonement, and the account of His ministry in the Americas.
The Book of Mormon confirms and expands the testimony of the Bible that Jesus is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior of the world.
Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon teach the law of witnesses: “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established” ( 2 Corinthians 13:1 ; see also 2 Nephi 11:2–3 ).
Consistent with this law, both books of scripture testify of Jesus Christ (see 2 Nephi 29:8 ).
