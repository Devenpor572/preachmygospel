Help Members and Leaders to Love, Share, and Invite
Encourage members to share the gospel in normal and natural ways.
The General Handbook offers instruction and videos to help members and leaders do this by living the principles of love, share, and invite (see General Handbook , 23.1.1 , 23.1.2 , and 23.1.3 ).
Keep these principles in mind as you work with leaders.
You will be a blessing to leaders as you support their efforts in this work.
In turn, their example will help members become more involved in sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members.
See “ Unite with Members ” in chapter 9 for ideas about supporting members in their efforts to share the gospel.
