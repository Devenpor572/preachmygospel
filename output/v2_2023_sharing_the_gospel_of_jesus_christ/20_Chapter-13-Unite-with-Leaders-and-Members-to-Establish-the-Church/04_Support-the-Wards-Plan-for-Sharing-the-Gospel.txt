Support the Ward’s Plan for Sharing the Gospel
The ward council creates a simple plan for sharing the gospel (see General Handbook , 23.5.6 ).
Become familiar with this plan.
In weekly coordination meetings, look for ways to help leaders work toward their goals.
Keep leaders informed about what you are doing to support members in sharing the gospel.
If you are invited to attend a ward council meeting, be prepared to give a brief update on the progress of those you are teaching and any assignments you have received (see General Handbook , 29.2.5 ).
See this opportunity as a time to build ward leaders’ confidence and trust.
