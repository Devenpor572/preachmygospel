The Lord Desires People to Come and Stay
Missionary work has its greatest effect as people make and keep the commitment to live the gospel and stay active in the Church throughout their lives.
It is not enough for them to simply come into the Church.
The Lord desires that they come to stay (see John 15:16 ).
Direct all your teaching and invitations toward that end.
To receive all the blessings that Heavenly Father has for them, members must continue to live the gospel by keeping the commandments and the covenants they have made as they stay active in the Church.
Nephi taught: “After ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?
Behold, I say unto you, Nay; … ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, … and [if ye] endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” ( 2 Nephi 31:19–20 ).
Give your best efforts to help people qualify for “eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God” ( Doctrine and Covenants 14:7 ).
