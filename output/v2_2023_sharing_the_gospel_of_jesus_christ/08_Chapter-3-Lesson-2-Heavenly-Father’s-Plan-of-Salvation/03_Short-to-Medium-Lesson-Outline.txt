What You Might Teach People in 3–10 Minutes
We are all spirit children of God.
We are members of His family.
He knows and loves each of us.
God has provided a plan for our happiness and progress in this life and in eternity.
In God’s plan, we needed to come to earth to receive physical bodies, learn, and grow.
Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan.
He makes it possible for us to have eternal life.
Under God’s direction, Jesus created the earth.
Our experiences on earth are intended to help us prepare to return to God’s presence.
Each of us sins, and each of us will die.
Because God loves us, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to redeem us from sin and death.
All that is unfair in life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
When our physical body dies, our spirit continues to live.
Eventually we will all be resurrected.
This means that each person’s spirit and body will be reunited, and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body.
When we are resurrected, Jesus Christ will be our judge.
With very few exceptions, all of God’s children will receive a place in a kingdom of glory.
We can return to live in God’s presence if we are faithful.
