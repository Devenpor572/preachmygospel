Qualifications for Baptism and Confirmation
God invites all His children to come unto Him through baptism and confirmation (see 2 Nephi 26:33 ; 3 Nephi 27:20 ).
The qualifications for baptism are the same for all.
From Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 :
Humble yourself before God.
Desire to be baptized.
Come forth with a broken heart and contrite spirit.
Repent of all your sins and pray for forgiveness.
Be willing to take upon yourself the name of Christ.
Have a determination to serve Christ to the end.
Show by your works that you have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of your sins.
From the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles:
Respond appropriately to the baptismal interview questions.
Receive all the missionary lessons.
Meet the elders quorum president, Relief Society president, and bishop.
Attend several sacrament meetings.
These qualifications are indicators of the spiritual process of conversion.
When people meet these qualifications, they are ready for the sacred ordinances of baptism and confirmation.
When a person has set a firm baptismal date:
Carefully review his or her record in the Preach My Gospel app to ensure that you have taught the necessary doctrine and commandments.
Create a schedule for the events that are needed to prepare for baptism and confirmation.
Review this schedule with the person.
If possible, invite the person to attend a baptismal service before his or her own baptism.
