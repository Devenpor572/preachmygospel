Confirmation
A person receives the ordinance of confirmation after he or she has been baptized (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:41 ).
A new convert is considered a member of the Church after the ordinances of baptism and confirmation are both completed and properly recorded.
Confirmations are under the direction of the bishop.
However, he does not conduct a separate interview for confirmation.
Work closely with the bishop and the ward mission leader (if one is called) to make sure that new converts are confirmed.
The confirmation should occur as soon as reasonable after baptism, preferably the next Sunday.
However, the bishop can allow the confirmation to take place at the baptismal service as an exception (see General Handbook , 18.8 ).
Converts are typically confirmed in a sacrament meeting in the ward where they live.
The bishop typically invites missionary elders serving in the ward to participate in the confirmation.
If a missionary performs the confirmation, he also needs approval from the mission president (see General Handbook , 18.8.1 ).
At least one member of the bishopric participates.
