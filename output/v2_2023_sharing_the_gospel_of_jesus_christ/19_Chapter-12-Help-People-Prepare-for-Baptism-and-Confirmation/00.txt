Consider This
How can I help people prepare for baptism and confirmation?
How do I conduct a baptismal interview?
How is an uplifting baptismal service planned and conducted?
Why is it important to complete and submit the Baptism and Confirmation Form?
How can I support new members?
Baptism is a joyous ordinance of hope that brings the power of God into a person’s life.
That power comes through receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.
It will continue as a person endures to the end in keeping the baptismal covenant.
The purpose of your teaching is to help others develop their faith in Jesus Christ, repent of their sins, and be baptized with a sincere desire to follow Christ.
As Mormon taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” (
Moroni 8:25
).
As the people you teach keep the commitments you invite them to make, they will be prepared to make and keep covenants with God and enjoy the promised blessings.
Baptism and confirmation are not a final destination.
Rather, these ordinances are the gate by which God’s children enter the covenant path.
This path leads to the ordinances, covenants, and joyous blessings of the temple—and ultimately to eternal life (see
3 Nephi 11:20–40
).
