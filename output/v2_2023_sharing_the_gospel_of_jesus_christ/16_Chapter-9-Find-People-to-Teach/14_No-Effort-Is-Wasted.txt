No Effort Is Wasted
When people choose not to learn more about the restored gospel, your efforts are not wasted.
Perhaps you have planted a seed that will grow at another time.
Whether that happens or not, your service and expressions of genuine love will bless both you and them.
If people are not ready to receive the gospel, see what else you can do to enrich their lives.
The relationships you develop are still meaningful and valuable.
Continue to be a friend.
People sometimes need time to consider the changes that are asked of them.
Help them receive messages through Church emails or websites.
These messages might help prepare people to accept future invitations to learn more.
When a person does not accept the gospel, it is natural to be disappointed.
However, as you turn to the Lord in such times, He has promised, “I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee” ( Isaiah 41:10 ).
Through faith in Christ, you can find peace and reassurance about your efforts.
Maintain a vision of who you are and why you are serving the Lord as a missionary.
Faith will help you press forward and continue in righteous desires.
Remember This
Finding people to teach should be a constant effort.
Exercise faith and expand your vision to find people to teach.
Keep multiple lines in the water.
Unite with members in finding people to teach.
Build strong relationships, and support them in their efforts to share the gospel.
Determine which ways of finding are most effective in your area, and use a variety of ways.
Prioritize activities that are more likely to help you find people who are being prepared to receive the gospel.
Pray for opportunities to do good and to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ.
