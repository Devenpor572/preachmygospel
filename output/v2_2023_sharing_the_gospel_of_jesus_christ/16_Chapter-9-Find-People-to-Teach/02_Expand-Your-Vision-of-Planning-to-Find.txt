Expand Your Vision of Planning to Find
As you seek to find people to teach, be aware of the difference between scheduling and planning .
Scheduling is filling up your planner and your day.
Planning is making a prayerful, purposeful effort to focus on people and the best ways to find them.
The right activity, at the right time and in the right location, can help you find people to teach.
Ask yourself the following questions:
Where might we meet people the Lord may be preparing?
What are the best places and types of activities to find people at specific times of the day or week?
How can we show love, serve them, or bring value to their lives right now?
How can we use personal strengths, skills, and talents to uplift them?
What are our backup plans if something doesn’t work out?
Try to recognize ways that the Lord is preparing people.
Are they willing to talk with you?
Are they seeking help or comfort?
Think about finding efforts that have been successful.
Where was the first interaction?
Did the efforts include local members?
Was technology used?
Begin your planning by focusing on how you can bless people, and then your schedule will take shape.
