Exercise Faith to Find People to Teach
Wherever you serve, the Lord has called you to labor “for the salvation of souls” ( Doctrine and Covenants 100:4 ).
To do this, you need to exercise faith in Christ to find people to teach so they can choose to follow Him and be baptized.
Faith is a principle of action and power.
Have faith that the Lord is preparing people to receive the restored gospel.
Have patient confidence that He will lead you to them, or them to you.
Act on your faith by setting goals, making plans, and carrying out your plans to find people to teach (see chapter 8 ).
Pray with faith as you seek God’s help to find people to teach.
When Alma led a mission to the Zoramites, he prayed: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ.
Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious … ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring [them] again unto thee” ( Alma 31:34–35 ).
The people you meet often do not realize that they are looking for the restored gospel until they have found it.
For example, one convert said, “When I heard the gospel, it filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t know was there.” Another said, “I have finished the search I didn’t know I was on.” Others are actively looking for the truth but do not know where to find it (see Doctrine and Covenants 123:12 ).
Seek the guidance of the Spirit as you look for people to teach.
Finding by the Spirit is as important as teaching by the Spirit.
Have faith that you will know how to find those who will receive you.
