Talk with Everyone
Develop a deep desire to bring souls to Christ (see Mosiah 28:3 ).
When you feel this desire, your love and concern will be reflected in your efforts to find.
Your love will also be reflected in your conversations.
Talk with as many people as you can each day.
Talk with them wherever you go.
Where appropriate, go from home to home.
The Lord instructed some of the early elders of the Church, “Open your mouth to declare my gospel.” He then promised that their mouths would “be filled” with what to teach ( Doctrine and Covenants 30:5 ; see also 33:7–10 ).
Similarly, the Lord told Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, “Lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts.” He then promised, “It shall be given you … in the very moment, what ye shall say” ( Doctrine and Covenants 100:5–6 ).
As you meet people, often you will feel the Spirit help you know what to say.
However, if you do not feel a prompting, just start somewhere—perhaps by asking a question and listening to their response (see “ Find People Where They Are ” in this chapter).
Or perhaps speak of the Lord Jesus Christ or of Joseph Smith’s calling to be a prophet of God.
The following ideas can help as you talk with those you meet:
Be warm, authentic, and friendly.
Look for ways to connect with the person and begin a conversation.
Listen sincerely to what people say.
Seek to understand each person’s needs and interests.
Offer personal help as appropriate.
Consider how the gospel can help meet their needs.
Then teach a basic gospel truth and invite them to learn more.
Share how the restored gospel can bring greater hope and meaning into their lives.
Ask about their families.
Help them see how the restored gospel can bless their families.
Offer to help them find the names of their deceased ancestors.
Invite them to come to sacrament meeting.
Offer pamphlets or other Church materials, both printed and digital.
Share with them your purpose as a missionary and why you decided to serve a mission.
These principles also apply to your interactions with members.
It is natural to be somewhat apprehensive about talking with people.
Pray for faith and courage to teach the restored gospel.
Everyone you meet is your brother or sister in the family of God.
Remember that He “denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; … all are alike unto God” ( 2 Nephi 26:33 ).
Personal or Companion Study
Read the account from Victor Manuel Cabrera in “ Thirsting for the Living Water ,” Ensign , Aug.
2001, 60–61.
As you do, look for how he was prepared to receive the missionaries and how the missionaries used an unplanned opportunity to teach him the gospel.
How had the man been prepared for the restored gospel?
What would have happened if the elders had not shared a gospel message?
Review what you did yesterday.
Did you talk with as many people as you could?
If not, set goals and make plans to talk with more people today.
