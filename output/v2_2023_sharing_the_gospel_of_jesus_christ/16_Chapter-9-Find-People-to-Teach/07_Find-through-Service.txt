Provide Opportunities for People to Come and Serve
People can have positive experiences and connect with missionaries and local members at service activities.
Many people are happy to share their talents, skills, or services and just need to be invited.
Invite people to participate in service activities organized by the ward.
You can also connect people with service opportunities such as those on JustServe.org where it is available.
As you serve with others, you come together in a powerful way.
Offer Service
Like the Savior, “[go] about doing good” ( Acts 10:38 ; see also “ Go about Doing Good ” in chapter 1).
Pray to be aware of opportunities to do good throughout each day.
Sometimes your service will be planned, but often it will be unplanned.
Find simple and immediate ways to serve, help, and lift people.
Remember that the Lord took unexpected opportunities to reach out and bless others.
Serve with a sincere desire to help people.
If the service leads to a teaching opportunity, be grateful.
If not, then be grateful to have done good for someone.
Answer questions if people ask them.
If someone expresses interest, reply briefly and arrange to meet at a different time to share a message.
Be sure to follow the guidelines for service in Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ , 2.7 and 7.2 .
