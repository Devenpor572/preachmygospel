Create a Language Study Plan
A language study plan helps both new and experienced missionaries focus on what they can do each day to improve their ability to speak their mission language.
Your plan will include what you will do during your language study time and throughout the day.
The following steps show how you can create a language study plan by using the goal-setting process from chapter 8.
Adapt this process as needed.
Prayerfully set goals and make plans.
Set weekly and daily goals to improve your general ability to communicate and teach the gospel.
Include things that you want to commit to memory, such as words, phrases, scriptures, and passages.
Record and schedule.
Decide which language tools will help you achieve your goals.
Language tools could include the scriptures, dictionaries, grammar books, the TALL Embark app, and others.
Schedule times when you will formally study and use the language.
For example, you might schedule to read aloud from the Book of Mormon for 15 minutes each day during lunch.
Act on your plans.
The Lord loves effort, so work diligently to accomplish your goals.
Protect your language study time and reschedule it for later if conflicts arise.
Review and follow up.
Review your study plan often to evaluate how well it is working.
Invite your companion, mission leaders, members, and others in your area to suggest ways you can improve.
Participate in regularly scheduled language assessments to chart your progress and identify ways to improve.
Balance your language study between long-term goals for creating a language foundation and short-term goals for specific activities and people you are teaching.
During your formal language study time, balance your goals and plans across the basic areas of language shown below.
Decide what you will learn throughout the day.
listening skills
reading skills
grammar
speaking skills
writing skills
vocabulary
Personal or Companion Study
Take time each week to evaluate your language study by asking the following questions:
Did I study my mission language each day this week?
What can I do to consistently improve my mission language?
Is my plan helping me find, teach, and work with members better?
What adjustments do I need to make to my plan?
What do I enjoy most about my language study?
What can I do to enjoy it more?
How much time should I be spending to practice listening, reading, writing, and speaking?
How can I better learn vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation?
What activities and resources am I using to study the language?
Which ones are helping me most?
What other resources or activities might be helpful?
What needs more attention?
After answering these questions, adjust your study plans and see if they improve your results.
The Spirit will guide you as you continually seek to improve your language study.
