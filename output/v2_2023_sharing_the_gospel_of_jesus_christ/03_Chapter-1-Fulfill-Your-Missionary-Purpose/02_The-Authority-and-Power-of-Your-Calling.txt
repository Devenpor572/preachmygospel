The Authority and Power of Your Calling
You are called and set apart to “[proclaim] glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” ( Doctrine and Covenants 79:1 ).
Like the sons of Mosiah, you can teach with the authority and power of God (see Alma 17:2–3 ).
Under Christ’s direction, the authority to preach the gospel was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith.
When you were set apart as a missionary, you received this authority.
With it comes the right, privilege, and responsibility to represent the Lord and teach His gospel.
This authority includes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling.
Take your setting apart literally.
Stay away from sin and from anything that is crude or vulgar.
Stay away from the ways and thinking of the world.
Follow the standards in Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ .
As the Lord’s representative, be “an example of the believers” ( 1 Timothy 4:12 ).
Honor the name of Jesus Christ by your actions and words.
In addition to authority, you need spiritual power to fulfill your calling.
God gives spiritual power as you consistently work to strengthen your testimony of Him, Jesus Christ, and the gospel truths you teach.
He bestows spiritual power as you pray, study the scriptures, and seek to fulfill your missionary purpose.
He grants spiritual power as you strive to keep His commandments and the covenants you made when you received the ordinances of salvation (see Doctrine and Covenants 35:24 ).
Spiritual power can be manifest as you:
Use the scriptures to teach people, deepen their understanding of gospel truths, and help them see how these truths apply to their lives (see 1 Nephi 19:23 ; Alma 26:13 ; 31:5 ).
Receive the Spirit’s guidance about what the Lord would have you say (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:85 ).
Receive the Spirit’s guidance about where to go and what to do (see Doctrine and Covenants 28:15 ; 31:11 ; 75:26–27 ).
Have your teaching and testimony confirmed by the witness of the Spirit (see 2 Nephi 33:1 ; Doctrine and Covenants 100:5–8 ).
Take part in the ordinances of salvation (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–20 ).
Give priesthood blessings if you are an elder (see James 5:14–15 ).
Pray with and for the people you work with (see Alma 6:6 ; 8:18–22 ; 10:7–11 ; 31:26–35 ; Doctrine and Covenants 75:19 ).
Express love and gratitude for the Lord, your family, other missionaries, and the people you serve (see Doctrine and Covenants 59:7 ; 78:19 ).
