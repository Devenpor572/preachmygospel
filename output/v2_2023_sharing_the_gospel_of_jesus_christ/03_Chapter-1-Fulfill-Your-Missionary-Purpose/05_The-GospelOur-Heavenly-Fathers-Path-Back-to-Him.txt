The Gospel—Our Heavenly Father’s Path Back to Him
The gospel of Jesus Christ can change how we live and who we become.
Its principles are not just steps that we experience once in our lives.
When we repeat them throughout life, they bring us closer to God and become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living.
They bring peace, healing, and forgiveness.
They also define the path our Heavenly Father has given for us to have eternal life with Him.
The gospel of Jesus Christ guides how you work as a missionary.
It also focuses your efforts.
Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance (see Alma 34:15–17 ).
Teach and testify that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored.
Invite people to be baptized and live by the Savior’s teachings.
