Consider This
What is my purpose as a missionary?
What authority and power come with my calling?
How do I rely on, recognize, and teach by the Spirit?
What is the gospel of Jesus Christ?
What is the message of the Restoration?
Why is it so important?
What is my responsibility to establish and build up the Church of Jesus Christ?
How will I know whether I am a successful missionary?
