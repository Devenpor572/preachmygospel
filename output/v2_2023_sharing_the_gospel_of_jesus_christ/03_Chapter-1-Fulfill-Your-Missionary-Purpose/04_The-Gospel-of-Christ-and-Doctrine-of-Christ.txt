The Gospel of Christ and Doctrine of Christ
The gospel of Jesus Christ deﬁnes both your message and your purpose.
It provides both the “what” and the “why” of your missionary service.
His gospel includes all the doctrine, principles, laws, commandments, ordinances, and covenants necessary for salvation and exaltation.
The gospel message is that we can access the saving, redeeming power of Jesus Christ by exercising faith in Him, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end (see 3 Nephi 27:13–22 ).
This is also known as the doctrine of Christ.
Living this doctrine is how we come unto Christ and are saved (see 1 Nephi 15:14 ).
This is powerfully taught in the Book of Mormon (see 2 Nephi 31 ; 32:1–6 ; 3 Nephi 11:31–40 ).
Your purpose is to help people come unto Christ by helping them live His doctrine.
“Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again; you will find that day after day, new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you.
You can enlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly.
You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those you teach” (Hyrum Smith, in History, 1838–1856, volume E-1 [1 July 1843–30 April 1844], 1994, josephsmithpapers.org ).

Faith in Jesus Christ
Faith is the foundation for all other gospel principles.
It is a principle of action and power.
Our faith needs to be centered in Jesus Christ for it to lead us to salvation.
The Savior taught, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” ( John 3:16 ).
Faith in Jesus Christ includes believing that He is the Only Begotten Son of God.
It is trusting Him as our Savior and Redeemer (see Mosiah 3:17 ; 4:6–10 ; Alma 5:7–15 ).
It is having full confidence in Him and His word, teachings, and promises.
Our faith in Christ grows as we follow His teachings and example with full purpose of heart (see 2 Nephi 31:6–13 ; 3 Nephi 27:21–22 ).
As a missionary, help people make and keep commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ.
These commitments prepare them to receive ordinances and make and keep sacred covenants with God.
Repentance
Faith in Jesus Christ leads us to repent (see Helaman 14:13 ).
Repentance is the process of turning to God and turning away from sin.
As we repent, our actions, desires, and thoughts change to be more in harmony with God’s will.
Through His atoning sacrifice, the Savior paid the price for our sins (see Mosiah 15:9 ; Alma 34:15–17 ).
As we repent, we can be forgiven because of Jesus Christ and His sacrifice, for He claims His rights of mercy for the penitent (see Moroni 7:27–28 ).
In the words of the prophet Lehi, our “redemption cometh … through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” ( 2 Nephi 2:6, 8 ).
Repentance is much more than exercising willpower to change a behavior or overcome a weakness.
Repentance is sincerely turning to Christ, who gives us the power to experience a “mighty change” in our hearts (see Alma 5:12–14 ).
It includes humbly yielding to the Spirit and submitting to God’s will.
As we repent, we increase our commitment to serve God and obey His commandments.
We are spiritually born again in Christ.
Repentance is a positive principle that brings joy and peace.
It brings us “unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of [our] souls” ( Helaman 5:11 ).
Be bold and loving in helping people understand why they should repent.
By inviting the people you teach to make commitments, you invite them to repent and you offer them hope.

Baptism
Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinance of baptism.
“The first fruits of repentance is baptism” ( Moroni 8:25 ).
We enter the gate to eternal life when we are baptized by immersion by one who has authority from God.
When we are baptized, we make a covenant with God.
As we keep this covenant, God promises to give us the companionship of the Holy Ghost, forgive our sins, and give us membership in the Church of Jesus Christ (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ; Moroni 6:4 ).
We are gathered to the Lord and spiritually reborn through this joyous and hopeful ordinance.
Baptizing and confirming the people you teach are central to your purpose.
Help them understand that to qualify for baptism, they need to meet the conditions in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 .

Confirmation and the Gift of the Holy Ghost
Baptism comes in two parts: baptism of water and baptism of the Spirit.
After we are baptized by water, baptism is completed when we are confirmed by the laying on of hands by one who has authority from God.
Through confirmation we can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and a remission of our sins.
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 95 ).
Alma taught, “All mankind … must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters; and thus they become new creatures” ( Mosiah 27:25–26 ).
For the penitent, baptism of water and of the Spirit is spiritual rebirth.

Enduring to the End
Following Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment.
We endure to the end as we continue throughout our lives to exercise faith in Christ, repent daily, receive all the ordinances and covenants of the gospel, keep those covenants, and have the companionship of the Holy Ghost.
This includes renewing the covenants we have made by partaking of the sacrament.
