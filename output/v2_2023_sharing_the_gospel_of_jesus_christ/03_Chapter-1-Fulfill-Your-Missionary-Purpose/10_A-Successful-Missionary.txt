A Successful Missionary
Your success as a missionary is determined primarily by your desire and commitment to find, teach, baptize, and confirm converts and to help them become faithful disciples of Christ and members of His Church (see Alma 41:3 ).
Your success is not determined by how many people you teach or help bring to baptism.
Nor is it determined by holding leadership positions.
Your success does not depend on how others choose to respond to you, to your invitations, or to your sincere acts of kindness.
People have agency to choose whether to accept the gospel message or not.
Your responsibility is to teach clearly and powerfully so they can make an informed choice that will bless them.
Think about the Savior’s parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14–28 .
The master, who represents the Lord, praised both of His faithful servants even though the size of their offerings differed (see Matthew 25:21, 23 ).
He also gave them both the same reward, inviting them to enter “into the joy of thy lord” because they magnified what they were given.
God has given you talents and gifts to use in His service.
Your talents and gifts are different from those of others.
Recognize that all of these are important, including those that are less visible.
As you consecrate your talents and gifts to Him, He will magnify them and work miracles with what you offer.
Avoid comparing yourself to other missionaries and measuring the outward results of your efforts with theirs.
Comparing usually leads to negative outcomes, such as discouragement or pride.
Comparing is also often misleading.
What the Lord wants is your own best effort—for you to “serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength” ( Doctrine and Covenants 4:2 ; emphasis added).
You may be sad if people do not accept the gospel yet.
Sometimes you may feel discouraged.
Even the great missionaries and prophets in the scriptures have sometimes felt discouragement (see 2 Nephi 4:17–19 ; Alma 26:27 ).
In such times, follow the example of Nephi by turning to the Lord, placing your trust in Him, praying for strength, and remembering the good things He has done for you (see 2 Nephi 4:16–35 ).
As you turn to the Lord in difficult times, He has promised, “I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee” ( Isaiah 41:10 ).
Through exercising faith in Christ, you can find peace and reassurance about your efforts.
Faith will help you press forward and continue in righteous desires.
Remain focused on your commitment to Christ and your missionary purpose—not the outward results.
These results often are not evident immediately.
At the same time, keep your expectations high regardless of the challenges you face.
High expectations will increase your effectiveness, your desire, and your ability to follow the Spirit.
Some ways you can evaluate your commitment to the Lord and your effort to be a successful missionary are outlined below.
Seek earnestly to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, learning of Him and improving little by little (see John 8:31 ; 2 Nephi 28:30 ).
Seek Christlike attributes (see 2 Peter 1:2–9 ; Doctrine and Covenants 4:5–6 ).
Love people sincerely and do your best every day to bring souls to Christ (see 1 Corinthians 13 ; Moroni 7:45–48 ).
Invite and help people to make and keep commitments that build their faith in the Savior.
Study the scriptures, and pray earnestly to express thanks and ask for divine help (see John 5:39 ; 2 Nephi 32:3 ; Enos 1:4 ; Alma 37:37 ; Doctrine and Covenants 26:1 ).
Obey God’s commandments and observe the missionary standards (see Doctrine and Covenants 35:24 ).
Live so the Spirit can guide you in where to go, what to do, and what to say (see Doctrine and Covenants 18:18 ; 42:14 ).
Prayerfully set goals, make plans, and work to fulfill them (see Luke 14:28 ; Doctrine and Covenants 88:119 ).
Build up and strengthen the ward or branch where you are assigned (see Doctrine and Covenants 18:5 ).
Go about doing good and serving people at every opportunity, whether they accept your message or not (see Acts 10:38 ).
When you have done your best, you may still have disappointments, but you will not be disappointed in yourself.
You can feel assured that the Lord is pleased when you feel the Spirit working through you.
