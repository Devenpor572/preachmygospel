How could a prophet help the world today?
From the beginning of the world, God has revealed the gospel to His children through prophets.
He has done this through His Son, Jesus Christ.
Anciently, Jesus revealed the gospel to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses.
But many people rejected it.
Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel and established His Church.
People even rejected Jesus.
Soon after His death, there was a widespread falling away from the Lord’s truth and Church.
The fulness of the gospel and the priesthood authority were no longer on the earth.
Centuries later, God called another prophet, Joseph Smith.
God restored the fulness of the gospel through him and authorized him to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again.
Having the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ on the earth is one of the great blessings of our day.
The gospel helps us answer life’s most searching questions.
Living prophets guide us through challenging times.
The priesthood authority of God is once again on the earth to bless His children.
