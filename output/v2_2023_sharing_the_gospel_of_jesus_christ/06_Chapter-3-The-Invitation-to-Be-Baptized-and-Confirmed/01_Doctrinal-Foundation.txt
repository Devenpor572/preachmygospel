Doctrinal Foundation
We are all children of Heavenly Father.
We have come to earth to have the opportunity to learn, grow, and become more like Him so we can return to His presence (see Moses 1:39 ).
We cannot become like Him or return to Him without divine help.
Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for us and break the bands of death (see 3 Nephi 27:13–22 ).
We gain access to Christ’s redeeming power by exercising faith in Him unto repentance, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost through confirmation, and enduring to the end.
Keeping the covenant of baptism is the first step in binding ourselves to God so the Holy Ghost can cleanse, strengthen, and change our nature for the better.
Experiencing this sanctifying influence is called spiritual rebirth.
(See 2 Nephi 31:7, 13–14, 20–21 ; Mosiah 5:1–7 ; 18 ; 27:24 ; 3 Nephi 27:20 ; John 3:5 .)
Spiritual rebirth begins when we are baptized by water and the Spirit.
Baptism is a joyous and hopeful ordinance.
When we are baptized with a broken heart and contrite spirit, we start life anew with God’s sustaining power.
After we are baptized and confirmed, we can continue to be strengthened by partaking of the sacrament worthily.
(See 2 Nephi 31:13 ; Mosiah 18:7–16 ; Moroni 6:2 ; Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 .)
