Consider This
How can I teach by the Spirit?
How can I teach from the scriptures?
How should I share my testimony when teaching?
How can I plan and adjust my teaching to meet people’s needs?
How can I ask better questions and be a better listener?
How can I help people find answers to their questions and receive guidance and strength?
You are called to teach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to as many people as will receive you.
Teaching is central to everything you do.
As you rely on the Lord for help, He has promised:
“And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face.
I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up” (
Doctrine and Covenants 84:88
).
Pray, study, and practice to improve your teaching ability.
Apply the principles in this chapter and in other chapters of this book.
Earnestly seek the gift of teaching so you can bless others and glorify God.
The Lord will help you teach with power and authority as you diligently seek Him and learn His word.
