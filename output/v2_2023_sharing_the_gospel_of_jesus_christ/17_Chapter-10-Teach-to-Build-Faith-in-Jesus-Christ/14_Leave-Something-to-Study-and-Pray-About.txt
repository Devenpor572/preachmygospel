Leave Something to Study and Pray About
At the end of each teaching visit, give people something to study, ponder, and pray about to prepare for the next meeting.
Reading, praying, and pondering between teaching visits invites the influence of the Holy Ghost into their lives.
You might invite people to read specific chapters in the Book of Mormon.
Or you might encourage them to use Church resources, such as Gospel Library, to find answers to questions, learn about a topic, or watch a video.
This can become an opening topic of discussion the next time you meet.
Avoid giving people too much to do, especially if you have short, frequent teaching interactions with them.
Personal or Companion Study
Consider each person you are scheduled to teach this week.
What chapters in the Book of Mormon will be most helpful to them?
What other resources would benefit them?
Record what you intend to provide for each person.
Also record what you will do to follow up during your next visit.
