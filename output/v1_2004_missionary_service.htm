  <p data-aid="128200066" id="p1">Dear Fellow Missionary:</p>
  <p data-aid="128200067" id="p2">We congratulate you on the great opportunity you have to be a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction.</p>
  <p data-aid="128200068" id="p3"><cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district council and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrine and principles.</p>
  <p data-aid="128200069" id="p4">We invite you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#p39">Moses 1:39</a>).</p>
  <p data-aid="128200070" id="p5">The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children.</p>

    <p data-aid="136329858" id="p1">Use <cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> to meet your needs as a missionary as you become a more deeply committed disciple of Jesus Christ. You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president.</p>
    <p data-aid="136329859" id="p2">All of the chapters in <cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/what-do-i-study-and-teach?lang=eng">chapter 3</a>, you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are addressed to you. Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience. You learn the doctrine in chapter 3 (a) to strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony and (b) to teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants.</p>
    <p data-aid="136329860" id="p3">The doctrine in some of the other chapters may also help you teach people. For example, chapter 4, “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-recognize-and-understand-the-spirit?lang=eng">How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?</a>” may help you teach people about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 5, “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/what-is-the-role-of-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng">What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?</a>” may help you resolve someone’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter 2, “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-study-effectively-and-prepare-to-teach?lang=eng">How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?</a>” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201319" id="p4"><cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> focuses on the essentials of missionary work. It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn.</p>
    <p data-aid="136329861" id="p5">Study the chapters throughout your mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="136329862" id="p6">You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through the first principles of the gospel, including faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. A lesson should rarely go over 45 minutes. You may find that a person’s schedule or your own time commitments may only allow shorter teaching visits. In that case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201323" id="p7"><span class="page-break" data-page="viii"></span>You can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the person you are teaching and the direction of the Spirit. Do not memorize the entire lesson.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128201325" id="p8">Effective study during your mission, including pondering and listening to the promptings of the Spirit, will help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Important study opportunities include personal study, companion study, district council, zone conferences, and mission leadership council (for mission leaders). Your missionary schedule includes time for personal and companion study most days.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201343" id="p9">What you learn in personal study will help you in companion study, district council, zone conferences, and mission leadership council, where you can “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.77?lang=eng#p77">Doctrine and Covenants 88:77</a>). What you gain from your study opportunities will help you teach with spiritual power.</p>

      </header>
      <p data-aid="128201376" id="p36"><cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> frequently asks that you use a study journal to help you understand, clarify, and remember what you are learning. Elder Richard G. Scott taught, “Knowledge carefully recorded is knowledge available in time of need. Spiritually sensitive information should be kept in a sacred place that communicates to the Lord how you treasure it. This practice enhances the likelihood of your receiving further light” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1993/10/acquiring-spiritual-knowledge?lang=eng&amp;para=p52#p52">Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> Nov. 1993, 86). Review your study journal regularly to recall spiritual experiences, see new insights, and recognize your growth.</p>
      <p data-aid="128201377" id="p37">Your study journal may be a bound journal, a notebook, or a binder. Record and organize your thoughts and impressions in a way that fits how you learn. Develop your own system to easily access key information in the future. Use it often to review, access, and apply what you have learned. Use your study journal to take notes and record impressions during your personal and companion study, district council, zone conferences, mission leadership council, and interviews with the mission president.</p>

Others help you focus your study, learn from the scriptures, apply what you learn, develop your abilities, and meet the needs of those you teach. In most cases, these boxes are simply a starting point. Prayerfully build on the activities in the boxes by developing new study activities and searching additional scriptures.</p>

    <p data-aid="128204923" id="p1">You are surrounded by people. You pass them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. They are all children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in life. They are concerned for their future and their families. They need the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23?lang=eng#p23">Doctrine and Covenants 59:23</a>), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.12?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 123:12</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204924" id="p2">
      The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored by the Savior through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless them and their families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their
      <span class="page-break" data-page="2"></span>deepest desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings of loneliness and guilt that come from sin. They need to experience the joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying the gift of the Holy Ghost.

    <p data-aid="128204925" id="p3">As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.6,8?lang=eng#p6">2 Nephi 2:6, 8</a>). As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” (Book of Mormon, title page).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204926" id="p4">As your understanding of the Savior’s sacrifice, also known as the Atonement of Jesus Christ, grows, your desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great … importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.8?lang=eng#p8">2 Nephi 2:8</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204927" id="p5">You are called to represent Jesus Christ in helping people become clean from their sins and find greater happiness and joy. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. President Dallin H. Oaks taught: “We have also said much about the inspired summary of our work: ‘teach repentance and baptize converts.’ But converts to what? To Jesus Christ our Savior and our Redeemer, to His doctrine, to His restored gospel, to His authority, to His name. Conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel should precede conversion to and membership in His Church. … Seek conversion to Jesus Christ and His gospel” (“Closing Remarks” [address given at the seminar for new mission presidents, June 28, 2017], 6, Church History Library, Salt Lake City).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204928" id="p6">To come to the Savior, people must have faith in Him unto repentance—making the necessary changes to bring their life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this commitment prepares them for the covenant of baptism and confirmation and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the “natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p19">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</p>

    <p data-aid="128204935" id="p7">The message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses individuals and families. Because of the Restoration we understand God’s purpose for His children: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&amp;para=p3#p3">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> May 2017, 145).</p>

    <p data-aid="128204939" id="p8">On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is that all individuals are part of God’s family and that families can be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&amp;para=p7#p7">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>,” 145).</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204957" id="p24">Missionaries are to go “in the power of the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/79.1?lang=eng#p1">Doctrine and Covenants 79:1</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="137163671" id="p127">As a missionary, you have authority to preach the gospel. President Dallin H. Oaks has taught: “Whoever functions in an office or calling received from one who holds priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/liahona/2014/05/priesthood-session/the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng&amp;para=p15#p15">The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> May 2014, 51). As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and authority of God (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2-3?lang=eng#p2">Alma 17:2–3</a>). If you hold the priesthood, you also have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204958" id="p25">
      When you were set apart by priesthood authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to the world. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The setting apart may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or vulgar;
      <em>set apart</em> from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (<cite>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</cite>
      ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 478).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204959" id="p26">Along with your authority comes a responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12?lang=eng#p12">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming; and love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name by your actions.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204960" id="p27">In addition to authority, you are also to exercise power in your work. The authority that you have received can lead to power. Indeed, spiritual power is one evidence that your authority is real. Spiritual power is a gift that makes it possible for you to do your work more effectively.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204961" id="p28">Your power and authority should be evident as you work and teach. Power may be manifest in many things you do, such as:</p>

    <p data-aid="128204224" id="p36">The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work.</p>
    <p data-aid="137163672" id="p128">
      The Book of Mormon teaches plainly the gospel of Jesus Christ. According to the Book of Mormon the gospel of Jesus Christ includes (1) faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) repentance through the Atonement of Christ; (3) baptism by immersion in Christ’s name; (4) the gift of the Holy Ghost; and (5) enduring to the end (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng">2 Nephi 31</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng">3 Nephi 11</a>; and <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng">3 Nephi 27</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="137163673" id="p129"><span class="page-break" data-page="6"></span>It also teaches us what we need to believe about Christ if we are to have faith in Him. For example, when He presented His gospel to the people in the New World, the Savior said: “I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me. And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.13-14?lang=eng#p13">3 Nephi 27:13–14</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="137163674" id="p130">The Savior added, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.21?lang=eng#p21">3 Nephi 27:21</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="137163675" id="p131">Additionally, the Book of Mormon provides insights to the kind of things we must do if we are to endure to the end, including the endowment and sealing ordinances of the temple, praying, fasting, studying the scriptures, following the example of the Savior, and obtaining Christlike attributes. In this context, the Book of Mormon teaches that we can become “saints through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p19">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</p>

    <p data-aid="128204231" id="p37">A purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive His mercy at the day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204233" id="p38">
      Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. That faith is developed as they follow the Savior’s example by humbling themselves, seeking God’s will, and obeying God’s commandments (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.6-7?lang=eng#p6">2 Nephi 31:6–7</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.13-14?lang=eng#p13">3 Nephi 27:13–14</a>). They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204235" id="p39">Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204236" id="p40">The doctrine of Christ can change how people believe and how they live; it also directs how you work and focuses your efforts.

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204248" id="p41">No matter where you serve or whom you teach, center your teaching on the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. “The Lord will bless you as you teach the message of the Restoration to a world that desperately needs the gospel of Jesus Christ” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, Dec. 11, 2002). As you study the doctrine in the missionary lessons, you will come to see that we have one message: Through a modern prophet, God has restored knowledge about the plan of salvation, which is centered on the Atonement of Jesus Christ and is fulfilled by living the principles and ordinances of the gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204250" id="p42">Make sure that everyone you teach clearly understands the following:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128204252" id="p43">God is our literal Father in Heaven. He loves us. Every person on earth is a child of God and a member of God’s family. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior and Redeemer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128204254" id="p44">Our loving Father in Heaven reached out to His children throughout biblical history by revealing His gospel to prophets. Sadly, many people rejected that gospel; even some of those who accepted it changed the doctrine and ordinances and fell into unbelief and apostasy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128204255" id="p45">Our Father in Heaven sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. The Savior performed miracles and taught His gospel. He accomplished the Atonement and was resurrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128204257" id="p46">Beginning with the First Vision, God has again reached out in love to His children. He restored the gospel of Jesus Christ and His priesthood authority and organized His Church on the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="137163676" id="p132">Because of the Savior’s Resurrection, all people will be resurrected and saved, or gain salvation, from physical death. This is an unconditional gift.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="137163677" id="p133">People may also be saved, or gain salvation, from individual spiritual death through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, by their faith in Him, by living in obedience to the laws and ordinances of His gospel, and by serving Him.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="137163678" id="p134">
          In addition to gaining salvation, we can also qualify for exaltation by being true to covenants made with God in the holy temple (see
          <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.14-20?lang=eng#p14">2 Nephi 31:14–20</a>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="137163679" id="p135">The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence of the restored gospel.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128204259" id="p47">As you help those you are teaching see the pattern of apostasy and restoration, they will be prepared to understand the great need for the latter-day Restoration. They will see the need to accept the restored gospel, receive the ordinances of salvation by the authority of the restored priesthood, and follow the way to eternal life. Help people recognize that the Church is not just another religion, nor is it an American church. Rather, it is a restoration of the “fulness of [the] gospel” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.23?lang=eng#p23">Doctrine and Covenants 1:23</a>), the same as was revealed and taught from the beginning.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204261" id="p48">
      The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. It is
      <span class="page-break" data-page="8"></span>the keystone of our religion, the most powerful resource for teaching this message. Some important truths restored through Joseph Smith include the knowledge that God is our Father and that we are His spirit children, that we lived with Him before birth, and that families can be exalted and live together forever in God’s presence through Christ’s Atonement by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204262" id="p49">The Book of Mormon is evidence of the love of God for His children. It bears witness of Jesus Christ and His divine calling as Savior of the world. It shows that God speaks to His children. As you teach and testify, invite people to read the Book of Mormon and pray about its message. Each person you teach must decide whether to accept the Book of Mormon as revelation from God.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204264" id="p50">
      Trust the remarkable promise in
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng#p3">Moroni 10:3–5</a>. Do all you can to persuade people to read the book, to help them understand it, and to motivate them to ask God sincerely whether it is true. The witness of the Holy Ghost becomes the cornerstone of their faith that Christ has restored His Church. Help those you teach to receive that spiritual confirmation.

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204283" id="p51">Help people qualify for baptism and confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent and change their lives through making and keeping commitments that build their faith in Jesus Christ. These commitments prepare people to make and keep sacred covenants.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204285" id="p52">Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “The first thing you will do when [someone] tells you he or she had not read and prayed about the Book of Mormon is be devastated! … Much of the time we are just too casual about all of this. This is eternal life. This is the salvation of the children of God. Eternity hangs in the balance. … It is the most important path [a person] will ever walk. But if he or she doesn’t know that, at least you do! … So take control of this situation. Teach with power and authority, and then be devastated if the first steps toward commandment-keeping and covenant-keeping have not been successfully begun” (“Making and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1997).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204287" id="p53">As you teach people to understand the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you “declare repentance” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15.6?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 15:6</a>). Repentance involves a change of heart and a desire to forsake sin and serve God. It involves humbly yielding to the Spirit and submitting to God’s will. It requires that people increase their commitment to live in agreement with God’s will. Repentance requires a sincere and lasting change of thoughts, desires, habits, and actions. It is a positive experience that brings joy and peace. Be bold and loving in helping people understand what they must do to repent. By inviting people to make commitments, you can effectively raise a voice of both warning and hope.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204307" id="p54">Baptizing and confirming the people you teach is central to your purpose. Baptism is for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost brings a host of blessings to those who live worthy of it. Through these ordinances people enter the gate and continue on the path to eternal life and exaltation. President Dallin H. Oaks said: “We do not preach and teach in order to ‘bring people into the Church’ or to increase the membership of the Church. We do not preach and teach just to persuade people to live better lives. … We invite all to come unto Christ by repentance and baptism and confirmation in order to open the doors of the celestial kingdom to the sons and daughters of God. No one else can do this” (“The Purpose of Missionary Work,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1995).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204309" id="p55">
      As you teach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, help people understand the sacred nature and need for both baptism by water and by the Spirit and confirmation as members of the Church. Help them realize that receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is a great blessing in this life and a key to their salvation. The Holy Ghost will “teach [them] all things” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/14.26?lang=eng#p26">John 14:26</a>). President Boyd K. Packer taught: “When you are teaching [people] and preparing them for baptism by water, you must also think of the gift of the Holy Ghost—baptism by fire. Think of it as one sentence. First comes the baptism of water and then the baptism of fire” (“The Gift of the Holy Ghost: What Every Missionary Should Know—and Every Member As Well” [address given at the seminar for new mission presidents, June 2003]). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (<cite>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</cite>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="137376590" id="p140">During His mortal ministry, the Savior “took upon him the form of a servant” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/philip/2.7?lang=eng#p7">Philippians 2:7</a>). He went about “doing good” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/acts/10.38?lang=eng#p38">Acts 10:38</a>) and “preaching the gospel” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4.23?lang=eng#p23">Matthew 4:23</a>). As you follow this example, you will find those whom you can serve and who will receive you.</p>
    <p data-aid="137376591" id="p141">
      Through service, you fulfill the two great commandments of loving God and your neighbor (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22.36-40?lang=eng#p36">Matthew 22:36–40</a>). Through service, you and those who are prepared for the restored gospel may also come together in a powerful, inspiring way. Your good works will help some people recognize you as a servant of God and may lead to opportunities to teach the restored gospel. However, Christlike service should be offered as a sincere expression of love for those around you, without the expectation of people listening to a gospel message or accepting a teaching visit.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="137376592" id="p142">
      <span class="page-break" data-page="11"></span>Many missionaries’ experience with service before their missions involved planned “service projects,” such as helping someone move, cleaning a local meetinghouse, or helping someone with yardwork. As a missionary, you will offer such planned service each week (see the
      <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/missionary-handbook/missionary-conduct?lang=eng&amp;para=title37#title37"><cite>Missionary Handbook</cite></a>
      for additional information). Under the direction of your mission president, you may find opportunities to serve in the community through JustServe (where it is approved), and the Church’s humanitarian and disaster response efforts.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="137376593" id="p143">The type of service described in this section focuses on unplanned opportunities. This type of service involves listening to the Spirit to recognize opportunities for small acts of kindness that you can offer to God’s children. Pray and be aware of opportunities throughout each day to do good.</p>

    <p data-aid="128205054" id="p61">Avoid comparing yourself to other missionaries and measuring the outward results of your efforts against theirs.

  <p data-aid="128200955" id="p1">The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.21?lang=eng#p21">Doctrine and Covenants 11:21</a>). To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.6?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 131:6</a>). The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior.</p>
  <p data-aid="128200956" id="p2">Effective daily study should begin with prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to learn, studying with “real intent” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4?lang=eng#p4">Moroni 10:4</a>), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.6?lang=eng#p6">Matthew 5:6</a>), and searching for answers to the questions and concerns of those you are teaching.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200970" id="p3">Your gospel study is most effective when you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire to repent and improve will grow.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200971" id="p4">This kind of study prepares you for service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. “For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.19?lang=eng#p19">1 Nephi 10:19</a>). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.3?lang=eng#p3">Enos 1:3</a>), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200972" id="p5">
      Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.8?lang=eng#p8">Jacob 4:8</a>). To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Doctrine and Covenants 9:7–8</a>). As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you are teaching.

      The missionary lessons (found in
      <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/what-do-i-study-and-teach?lang=eng">chapter 3</a>) contain the baptismal interview questions, commitments, and doctrine that you are to teach. In the lessons you will also find useful ideas for teaching. However, the lessons do not tell you everything to say—or how to say it. Instead, you are responsible to thoroughly understand the lessons and teach by the Spirit in your own words.

As you gain experience, you will want to deepen your knowledge and enhance your teaching ability. As you prepare for teaching appointments, you will want to have a lesson plan that enables you to teach by the Spirit and help others make and keep commitments. The guidelines below are suggestions that you can apply throughout your mission. However, do not feel that you must use every guideline in every situation. Instead, apply these guidelines to meet your needs and as you are guided by the Spirit. If you are learning a new language, apply these guidelines in your native language first and then in your mission language.</p>

      <li>
        <p data-aid="128202052" id="p21"><strong>Learn and apply the doctrine.</strong> The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the scriptures, lessons, and other approved resources to gain a solid understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries.</p>

      <li>
        <p data-aid="128202053" id="p22"><strong>Organize and summarize what to teach.</strong> To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, examples, and appropriate and approved media. These should vary according to the length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely new lesson plan for each person you teach, but you should continually refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet specific needs. When you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128202054" id="p23"><strong>Focus on needs.</strong> While the doctrine of the gospel applies to everyone, you should adjust your teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism and confirmation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128202055" id="p24"><strong>Prepare to answer questions.</strong> As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other approved resources for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for reference.</p>

As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. Ask for ideas and suggestions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128202057" id="p26"><strong>Evaluate your teaching.</strong> After every teaching situation, evaluate the experience. Did you focus on the doctrine? Is their faith in Christ and His Atonement growing? Did you invite them to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you teach them how to pray and study the scriptures? Are they praying, studying the Book of Mormon, and attending church? Did you work to prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? Adjust your lesson plans as you improve.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128202058" id="p27">As you learn the lessons, continue seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85?lang=eng#p85">Doctrine and Covenants 84:85</a>).</p>

      <p data-aid="128202060" id="p28">We have a powerful message with a unique vocabulary. Just as a physician speaks differently in the family waiting room than in the operating room, so too must you learn to speak so that those who are unfamiliar with our message can understand what you are teaching.</p>
      <p data-aid="128202061" id="p29">To prepare to help others understand unfamiliar words, study the list of key definitions and terms in the “Ideas for Teaching” section of each applicable lesson. Become familiar with the definitions provided. Use approved resources to find definitions for other words. Write these definitions in your study journal. Share the definitions with your companion and others to see if you understand. If the definitions are unclear to others, revise your definitions based on the material you have studied.</p>
      <p data-aid="128202062" id="p30">As you teach, seek to discern whether a word or principle is new to the person you are teaching. Take time to explain unfamiliar words or principles. Remember to teach for understanding so that you and those you teach “are edified and rejoice together” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.22?lang=eng#p22">Doctrine and Covenants 50:22</a>).</p>

      </header>
      <p data-aid="128202119" id="p67">Marking or annotating your scriptures can assist you in thinking deeply about a passage or doctrine of the gospel. You can mark your scriptures in many ways. Find a method that works for you. Below are some guidelines for marking a printed version of the scriptures.</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128202120" id="p68">Use pencils or colored markers. Avoid using pens that bleed through the paper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128202121" id="p69">Shade, underline, bracket, or outline part of a verse, an entire verse, or a group of verses.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128202122" id="p70">Avoid excessive marking. The benefit is lost if you cannot understand your markings because you have made too many notes, lines, and colors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128202123" id="p71">Underline only a few key words to highlight the verse, section, or chapter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128202124" id="p72">Circle or underline key words, and then use straight lines to link closely related words.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128202125" id="p73">When a series of points in a verse or passage are related, number the points in the margin or text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128202126" id="p74">Use the footnotes as a resource for marking and interpreting the scriptures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128202127" id="p75">Place a symbol (such as a check mark) in the margin for key verses you feel are critical to remember.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p data-aid="128202128" id="p76">Marking your scriptures should help you focus on applying what you learn and on teaching others. Develop an approach that is consistent and helps you accomplish your purpose as a missionary.</p>

  <p data-aid="128204158" id="p9">Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching all of the lessons before baptism and again after baptism, with the help of ward missionaries and other members. After baptism, encourage each new member to keep all the commitments in these lessons.</p>
  <p data-aid="128204159" id="p10">You should also use these lessons in individual and companion study, district council, and other training settings.

  <p data-aid="128204160" id="p11">
    As a missionary, you have a great responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct
    <span class="page-break" data-page="30"></span>both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the [person]. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, Dec. 11, 2002). As you and your companion study these lessons and prepare to teach, keep these instructions firmly in mind. Make sure that you teach all the doctrine in these lessons.
  </p>
  <p data-aid="128204161" id="p12">Let the Spirit guide the order in which you present the first three lessons based on the person’s needs, interests, and situation. A few of the commandments may also be included as appropriate or be taught as lessons of their own. Prayerfully decide what to teach and which invitations to extend. Be mindful of the person’s questions and level of understanding.</p>
  <p data-aid="128204162" id="p13">Each lesson outlines the baptismal interview questions, commitments, and doctrine that you are to teach. Thoroughly learn the doctrine. Consistently focus on helping those you teach make and keep the commitments. Use the baptismal interview questions to prepare those you teach for baptism and confirmation. The lessons also have ideas for teaching. Use these suggestions to strengthen how you prepare and teach.</p>

They should memorize vocabulary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lesson, but only after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire lessons.</p>

He understands and feels our sorrows and rejoices in our progress. He wants to communicate with us, and we can communicate with Him through sincere prayer.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202854" id="p2">He has given us this experience on the earth so we can learn and grow. We can show our love for Him through our choices and our obedience to His commandments.</p>

However, we must be pure and clean through obedience in order to do so. Disobedience moves us away from Him. Central to our Father’s plan is Jesus Christ’s Atonement. Jesus Christ’s Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane as well as His suffering and death on the cross. Through Christ’s Atonement we can be freed from the burden of our sins and develop faith and strength to face our trials.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128202904" id="p4">The restored gospel of Jesus Christ blesses individuals and families. It helps husbands and wives, parents and children as they strive to develop stronger relationships and spiritual strength in their families. These blessings are available now and in eternity. The gospel of Jesus Christ provides help with current concerns and challenges.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202906" id="p5">The message of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that all individuals are part of God’s family and that families can be united now and in eternity. Because families are ordained of God, they are the most important social unit in time and in eternity. God has established families to bring happiness to His children, allow them to learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere, and prepare them for eternal life. The home is the best place to teach, learn, and apply principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety. It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide, blessing family members with peace, joy, and happiness. Through prophets in every age, including our own, God has revealed His plan of happiness for individuals and families.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128202910" id="p6">
      One important way that God shows His love for us is by calling prophets, who are given the priesthood—the power and authority given to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Prophets learn the gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation. They in
      <span class="page-break" data-page="33"></span>turn teach the gospel to others and testify of Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer. The teachings of prophets are found in sacred books called scriptures.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128202912" id="p7">Our Father’s plan for us to be successful in this life and to return to live with Him is called the gospel of Jesus Christ, with Jesus’s Atonement at the center of that plan. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can receive eternal life if we exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. “This is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.21?lang=eng#p21">2 Nephi 31:21</a>). All people have the gift of agency, which includes the freedom to accept or reject the gospel as taught by the prophets and apostles. Those who choose to obey are blessed, but those who ignore, reject, or distort the gospel do not receive God’s promised blessings.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202914" id="p8">Whenever people choose to disregard, disobey, or distort any gospel principle or ordinance, whenever they reject the Lord’s prophets, or whenever they fail to endure in faith, they distance themselves from God and begin to live in spiritual darkness. Eventually this leads to a condition called apostasy. When widespread apostasy occurs, God withdraws His priesthood authority to teach and administer the ordinances of the gospel.</p>

    <p data-aid="128202916" id="p9">Biblical history has recorded many instances of God speaking to prophets, and it also tells of many instances of apostasy. To end each period of general apostasy, God has shown His love for His children by calling another prophet and giving him priesthood authority to restore and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ anew. In essence, the prophet acts as a steward to oversee the household of God here on earth. Such periods of time headed by prophetic responsibility are called dispensations.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202918" id="p10">God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ to Adam and gave him priesthood authority. Adam was the first prophet on the earth. By revelation, Adam learned of mankind’s proper relationship with God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ; and of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Adam and Eve taught their children these truths and encouraged them to develop faith and to live the gospel in all aspects of their lives. Adam was followed by other prophets, but over time the posterity of Adam rejected the gospel and fell into apostasy, choosing to be unrighteous.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202920" id="p11">Thus began the pattern of prophetic dispensations that makes up much of the recorded history of the Old Testament. Heavenly Father revealed His gospel through direct communication to prophets such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Each prophet was called by God to begin a new dispensation of the gospel. To each of these prophets God granted priesthood authority and revealed eternal truths. Unfortunately, in each dispensation people eventually used their agency to choose to reject the gospel and then fell into apostasy.</p>

      </header>
      <p data-aid="128202924" id="figure5_p1">Determine what the person you are teaching understands about prophets. In most cultures there are people who believe that holy or inspired people receive some form of guidance and direction from Deity. However, not all inspired individuals are prophets of God as defined in the restored gospel. Explain clearly that God establishes His kingdom on the earth by calling a prophet to establish a new dispensation. He gives that prophet priesthood authority. The prophet then helps people understand their relationship to Deity, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p data-aid="128202926" id="figure5_p2">You might wonder how gospel dispensations are relevant when teaching people who do not have a Christian background or culture. But you will find that by briefly relating the history of gospel dispensations, you can help people understand that God loves His children and that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128202952" id="p12">A few hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ, people again fell into apostasy. But when the Savior began His mortal ministry He established His Church again on the earth.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202954" id="p13">Heavenly Father sent His Son to the earth to atone for the sins of all mankind and overcome death: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son … that the world through him might be saved” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/3.16-17?lang=eng#p16">John 3:16–17</a>). Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take upon Him, by His suffering, the sins of all who would live on this earth and to overcome physical death. The Savior made an infinite atoning sacrifice so that if we have faith in Him, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end, we can receive forgiveness of our sins and enter and follow the path that will lead us to eternal life in God’s presence (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13-21?lang=eng#p13">2 Nephi 31:13–21</a>).</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128202974" id="p16">After the death of Jesus Christ, wicked people persecuted the Apostles and Church members and killed many of them. With the death of the Apostles, priesthood keys and the presiding priesthood authority were taken from the earth. The Apostles had kept the doctrine of the gospel pure and maintained the order and standard of worthiness for Church members. Without the Apostles, over time the doctrine was corrupted, and unauthorized changes were made in Church organization and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism and conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202976" id="p17">Without revelation and priesthood authority, people relied on human wisdom to interpret the scriptures and the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. False ideas were taught as truth. Much of the knowledge of the true character and nature of God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was lost. Important parts of the doctrine of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost became distorted or forgotten. The priesthood authority given to Christ’s Apostles was no longer present on the earth. This apostasy eventually led to the emergence of many churches.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202978" id="p18">After centuries of spiritual darkness, truth-seeking men and women protested against current religious practices. They recognized that much of the doctrine and many of the ordinances of the gospel had been changed or lost. They sought for greater spiritual light, and many spoke of the need for a restoration of truth. None of these people claimed, however, that God had called them to be a prophet. Instead, they tried to reform teachings and practices that they believed had been changed or corrupted. Their efforts led to the organization of many Protestant churches. This Reformation resulted in an increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for the final Restoration.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202980" id="p19">The Savior’s Apostles foretold this universal apostasy. They also foretold that the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church would be restored once more upon the earth.</p>

If there had been no apostasy, there would have been no need of a Restoration. As a diamond displayed on black velvet appears more brilliant, so the Restoration stands in striking contrast to the dark background of the Great Apostasy. As guided by the Spirit, teach people about the Great Apostasy at a level of detail appropriate to their needs and circumstances. Your purpose is to help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

            <p data-aid="128203029" id="figure9_p2">
              The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (see
              <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19-20?lang=eng#p19">Ephesians 2:19–20</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4.11-14?lang=eng#p11">4:11–14</a>). These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer the priesthood authority upon others.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p data-aid="128203031" id="figure9_p3">
              People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles (see
              <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24.9?lang=eng#p9">Matthew 24:9</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.32-34?lang=eng#p32">1 Nephi 11:32–34</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.5?lang=eng#p5">2 Nephi 27:5</a>). With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was absent from the Church. Consequently, there was no longer authority to confer the Holy Ghost or perform other saving ordinances. Revelation ceased, and doctrine became corrupted.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p data-aid="128203033" id="figure9_p4">
              Even before the death of the Apostles, many conflicts concerning doctrine arose. The Roman Empire, which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by councils. The simple doctrine and ordinances taught by the Savior were debated and changed to conform to worldly philosophies (see
              <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/isa/24.5?lang=eng#p5">Isaiah 24:5</a>). They physically changed the scriptures, removing plain and precious doctrine from them (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.26-40?lang=eng#p26">1 Nephi 13:26–40</a>). They created creeds, or statements of belief, based on false and changed doctrine (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng#p19">Joseph Smith—History 1:19</a>). Because of pride, some aspired to positions of influence (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/3-jn/1.9-10?lang=eng#p9">3 John 1:9–10</a>). People accepted these false ideas and gave honor to false teachers who taught pleasing doctrines rather than divine truth (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.3-4?lang=eng#p3">2 Timothy 4:3–4</a>).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p data-aid="128203035" id="figure9_p5">Throughout history, many people have sincerely believed false creeds and doctrines. They have worshipped according to the light they possessed and have received answers to their prayers. Yet they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.12?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 123:12</a>).</p>

          <li>
            <p data-aid="128203037" id="figure9_p6">Therefore, a restoration, not a reformation, was required. Priesthood authority did not continue in an unbroken line of succession from the Apostle Peter. To reform is to change what already exists; to restore is to bring back something in its original form. Thus, restoration of priesthood authority through divine messengers was the only possible way to overcome the Great Apostasy.</p>

      <h2 data-aid="128203039" id="title7">The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith</h2>
    </header>
    <p data-aid="128203041" id="p20">When the circumstances were right, Heavenly Father once again reached out to His children in love. He called a young man named Joseph Smith as a prophet. Through him the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203043" id="p21">Joseph Smith lived in the United States, which was perhaps the only country to enjoy religious freedom at the time. It was at a time of great religious excitement in the eastern United States. His family members were deeply religious and constantly sought for truth. But many ministers claimed to have the true gospel. Joseph desired “to know which of all the sects was right” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.18?lang=eng#p18">Joseph Smith—History 1:18</a>). The Bible taught there was “one Lord, one faith, one baptism” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4.5?lang=eng#p5">Ephesians 4:5</a>). Joseph attended different churches, but he remained confused about which church he should join. He later wrote:</p>
    <p data-aid="128203045" id="p22"><span class="page-break" data-page="37"></span>“So great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was … to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. … In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.8,10?lang=eng#p8">Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128203047" id="p23">As Joseph sought truth among the different faiths, he turned to the Bible for guidance. He read, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/james/1.5?lang=eng#p5">James 1:5</a>). Because of this passage, Joseph decided to ask God what he should do. In the spring of 1820 he went to a nearby grove of trees and knelt in prayer. We have four different accounts of what followed, recorded by him or scribes under his direction (see Gospel Topics essay, “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/gospel-topics/first-vision-accounts?lang=eng">First Vision Accounts</a>”). In one account, he described his experience:</p>
    <p data-aid="128203050" id="p24">“I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. … When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—<em>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</em>” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.16-17?lang=eng#p16">Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17</a>).</p>

    <p data-aid="128203052" id="p25">In this vision God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith. The Savior told Joseph not to join any of the churches, for they “were all wrong” and “all their creeds were an abomination.” He stated, “They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng#p19">Joseph Smith—History 1:19</a>). Even though many good people believed in Christ and tried to understand and teach His gospel, they did not have the fulness of truth or the priesthood authority to baptize and perform other saving ordinances. They had inherited a state of apostasy as each generation was influenced by what the previous one passed on, including changes in the doctrine and in ordinances such as baptism. As God had done with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other prophets, He called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel was restored to the earth.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203055" id="p26">After the appearance of the Father and the Son, other heavenly messengers, or angels, were sent to Joseph Smith and his associate Oliver Cowdery. John the Baptist appeared and conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, which includes the authority to perform the ordinance of baptism. Peter, James, and John (three of Christ’s original Apostles) appeared and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, restoring the same authority given to Christ’s Apostles anciently. With this priesthood authority, Joseph Smith was directed to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again on the earth. Through him, Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203058" id="p27"><span class="page-break" data-page="38"></span>The time in which we live is referred to by Bible prophets as the last days, the latter days, or the dispensation of the fulness of times. It is the period of time just before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. It is the final dispensation. This is why the Church is named The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203061" id="p28">A living prophet directs the Church today. This prophet, the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is the authorized successor to Joseph Smith. He and the present Apostles trace their authority to Jesus Christ in an unbroken chain of ordinations through Joseph Smith.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128203096" id="p29">Knowing that doubt, disbelief, and misinformation would remain after centuries of darkness, our loving Heavenly Father brought forth an ancient volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible, which contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. This volume of holy scripture provides convincing evidence that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God. This record is the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203099" id="p30">Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly messenger named Moroni to a hill where golden plates had lain hidden for centuries. These golden plates contained the writings of prophets giving an account of God’s dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Joseph Smith translated the contents of these plates by the power of God. The prophets in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of the Savior and taught His gospel. After His Resurrection, Christ appeared to these people. He taught them His gospel and established His Church. The Book of Mormon proves that “God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.11?lang=eng#p11">Doctrine and Covenants 20:11</a>). In order to know that the Book of Mormon is true, a person must read it and ponder and pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203102" id="p31">Reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that the true Church has been restored to the earth.</p>

      This message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ is either true or it is not. We can know that it is true by the power of the Holy Ghost, as promised in
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng#p3">Moroni 10:3–5</a>. Consistent study of the scriptures (particularly the Book of Mormon), regular church attendance, and sincere prayer help us feel the power of the Holy Ghost and discover truth. After reading and pondering the message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask our Heavenly Father in prayer in the name of Jesus Christ if it is true.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="137171666" id="p62">Because God is our Father and we are His children, He will help us recognize truth. When we pray with faith, sincerity, and real intent—a commitment to act on the answers we receive—God will answer our questions, guide our lives, and help us make good decisions.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171667" id="p63">When we pray, we address our Heavenly Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths without prayer.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203151" id="p33">In answer to our prayers, the Holy Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true, we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203154" id="p34">Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him.</p>

      <p data-aid="128203159" id="figure15_p1">Although prayer has a role in many religions and cultures, it is rarely considered to be a two-way communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the end of the lesson.</p>

      <p data-aid="128203238" id="figure19_p1">Our message is remarkable and simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel and established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrine and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church.</p>
      <p data-aid="128203241" id="figure19_p2">
        Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the
        <span class="page-break" data-page="42"></span>Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true.

        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203396" id="p40"><strong>Agency:</strong> The ability and privilege God gives people to choose and to act for themselves.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203398" id="p41"><strong>Apostasy:</strong> A turning away from the truth by individuals, the Church, or entire nations. It includes rebellion against authority and rejection of prophets. Evidence of apostasy includes transgressing God’s laws, changing gospel ordinances, and breaking covenants (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/isa/24.5?lang=eng#p5">Isaiah 24:5</a>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203400" id="p42"><strong>Dispensation:</strong> A period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood. In addition to Jesus Christ, prophets such as Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Joseph Smith have each started a new gospel dispensation. When the Lord organizes a dispensation, the gospel is revealed anew so that the people of that dispensation do not have to depend on past dispensations for knowledge of the plan of salvation. The dispensation begun by Joseph Smith is known as the “dispensation of the fulness of times.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203403" id="p43"><strong>Priesthood:</strong> The authority and power that God gives to man to act in the name of Jesus Christ in all things for the salvation of mankind.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203406" id="p44"><strong>Prophet:</strong> A man who has been called by and speaks for God. As a messenger of God, a prophet receives priesthood authority, commandments, prophecies, and revelations from God. His responsibility is to make known God’s will and true character to mankind and to show the meaning of His dealings with them. A prophet denounces sin and foretells its consequences. He is a preacher of righteousness. On occasion, a prophet may be inspired to foretell the future for the benefit of mankind. His primary responsibility, however, is to bear witness of Christ.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203408" id="p45"><strong>Redeemer:</strong> Jesus Christ is the great Redeemer of mankind because He, through His Atonement, paid the price for the sins of mankind and made possible the Resurrection of all people. To redeem is to deliver, to purchase, or to ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment. Redemption refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin. Jesus’s Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death. Through His Atonement, which includes His suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross as well as His Resurrection, those who have faith in Him and who repent are redeemed from spiritual death.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203411" id="p46"><strong>Reformer:</strong> To reform is to make changes to something in order to improve it. The term <i>reformers</i> refers to those men and women (such as <a href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-1-the-message-of-the-restoration-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng#figure21_p3">Martin Luther</a>, <a href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-1-the-message-of-the-restoration-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng#figure21_p5">William Tyndale</a>, and <a href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-1-the-message-of-the-restoration-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng#figure21_p1">John Wycliffe</a>) who protested the practices of the existing church, which they felt needed to be reformed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203414" id="p47"><strong>Restoration:</strong> To restore means to return to a former condition, or to bring back. The Restoration, as used by Latter-day Saints, means that the true Church of Jesus Christ, which was lost through apostasy, was brought back as it originally existed when organized by Jesus Christ. Unlike the Reformation, the Restoration was accomplished by divine authority through revelation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203416" id="p48"><strong>Revelation:</strong> Communication from God to His children on earth. Revelation may come through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost by way of inspiration, visions, dreams, or visits by angels. Revelation provides guidance that can lead the faithful to eternal salvation in the celestial kingdom. The Lord reveals His work to His prophets and confirms to believers that the revelations to the prophets are true (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7?lang=eng#p7">Amos 3:7</a>). Through revelation, the Lord provides individual guidance for every person who seeks it and who has faith, repents, and is obedient to the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p data-aid="128203117" id="figure2_p1">Missionaries are to testify of Jesus Christ and invite all to come unto Him that they might be saved and receive increased happiness, comfort, joy, and peace in this life. Providing specific instruction about the Savior is important for those who know little or nothing about Him. The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is designed to help all people know that “Jesus is the Christ, … manifesting himself unto all nations” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng">title page of the Book of Mormon</a>). One of the most effective ways to teach and testify of the Savior is to read together from the Book of Mormon. Passages from other standard works can also be helpful.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203120" id="figure2_p2">Consider the suggestions listed below. This activity may also be done as part of this or other lessons or as a lesson of its own. When helpful, repeat this activity several times before and after baptism and confirmation.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128203300" id="p1">Many people wonder, “Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going?” The plan of salvation gives us the answers to these questions.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203304" id="p2">God is the Father of our spirits. We are literally His children, and He loves us. We lived as spirit children of our Father in Heaven before we were born on this earth. We were not, however, like our Heavenly Father, nor could we ever become like Him and enjoy all the blessings that He enjoys without the experience of living in mortality with a physical body.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203307" id="p3">God’s whole purpose—His work and His glory—is to enable each of us to enjoy all His blessings. He has provided a perfect plan to accomplish His purpose. We understood and accepted this plan before we came to the earth. In the scriptures God’s plan is called a merciful plan, the plan of happiness, the plan of redemption, and the plan of salvation.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203311" id="p4">Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan. Through His Atonement, Jesus Christ fulfilled His Father’s purpose and made it possible for each of us to enjoy immortality and exaltation. Satan, or the devil, is an enemy to God’s plan.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203315" id="p5">Agency, or the ability to choose, is one of God’s greatest gifts to His children. Our eternal progression depends on how we use this gift. We must choose whether to follow Jesus Christ or follow Satan.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203319" id="p6">We are physically separated from God during life on earth, but He wants every one of His children to find peace in this life and a fulness of joy in His presence after this life. He wants us to become like Him.</p>

In order to progress and become like God, each of us had to obtain a body and be tested during a time of probation on the earth. While on the earth we are out of God’s physical presence. We do not remember our premortal life. We must walk by faith rather than by sight.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128203421" id="p8">Adam and Eve were the first of God’s children to come to the earth. God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were created in God’s image, with bodies of flesh and bones. While Adam and Eve were in the garden, they were still in God’s presence and could have lived forever. They lived in innocence, and God provided for their needs.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203425" id="p9">In the Garden of Eden, God gave Adam and Eve their agency. He commanded them not to eat the forbidden fruit, or the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Obeying this commandment meant that they could remain in the garden, but they could not progress by experiencing opposition in mortality. They could not know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203429" id="p10">Satan tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and they chose to do so. This was part of God’s plan. Because of this choice, they were cast from the garden and out of God’s physical presence. This event is called the Fall. Separation from God’s presence is spiritual death. Adam and Eve became mortal—subject to physical death, or separation of the body and spirit. They could now experience disease and all types of suffering. They had moral agency or the ability to choose between good and evil. This made it possible for them to learn and progress. It also made it possible for them to make wrong choices and to sin. In addition, they could now have children, so the rest of God’s spirit children could come to earth, obtain physical bodies, and be tested. Only in this way could God’s children progress and become like Him.</p>

        When first teaching this doctrine, explain very simply that God chose two of His children, Adam and Eve, to become the first parents on earth. After their transgression they were subject to both sin and death. By themselves they could not return to live with Heavenly Father. The Lord spoke to Adam and taught him the plan of salvation and redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ. By following that plan, Adam and his family could have joy in this life and return to live with God (see

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128203485" id="p11">Life on earth is an opportunity and a blessing. Our purpose in this life is to have joy and prepare to return to God’s presence. In mortality we live in a condition where we are subject to both physical and spiritual death. God has a perfect, glorified, immortal body of flesh and bones. To become like God and return to His presence, we too must have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones. However, because of the Fall of Adam and Eve, every person on earth has an imperfect, mortal body and will eventually die. If not for the Savior Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203488" id="p12">Along with physical death, sin is a major obstacle that keeps us from becoming like our Father in Heaven and returning to His presence. In our mortal condition we often yield to temptation, break God’s commandments, and sin. During our life on earth each of us makes mistakes. Although it sometimes appears otherwise, sin always leads to unhappiness. Sin causes feelings of guilt and shame. Because of our sins, we are unable to return to live with Heavenly Father unless we are first forgiven and cleansed.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203491" id="p13">While we are in mortality, we have experiences that bring us happiness. We also have experiences that bring us pain and sorrow, some of which is caused by the sinful acts of others. These experiences provide us opportunities to learn and to grow, to distinguish good from evil, and to make choices. God influences us to do good; Satan tempts us to commit sin. As with physical death, we cannot overcome the effects of sin by ourselves. We are helpless without the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p data-aid="128203543" id="p14">Before the world was organized, our Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ to be our Savior and Redeemer. The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ made it possible for us to overcome the effects of the Fall. All of the prophets since the world began have testified of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203545" id="p15">We will all suffer physical death, but Jesus Christ overcame the obstacle of physical death for us. When He died on the cross, His spirit became separated from His body. On the third day, His spirit and His body were reunited eternally, never to be separated again. He appeared to many people, showing them that He had an immortal body of flesh and bone. The reuniting of body and spirit is called resurrection and is a gift promised to each of us. Because of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, we will all be resurrected regardless of whether we have done good or evil in this life. We will have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones that will never again be subject to disease, pain, or death. The Resurrection makes it possible to return to God’s presence to be judged but does not guarantee that we will be able to live in His presence. To receive that blessing, we must also be cleansed from sin.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203547" id="p16">God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to overcome the obstacle of sin in addition to the obstacle of physical death. We are not responsible for the Fall of Adam and Eve, but we are responsible for our own sins. God cannot look on sin with any degree of allowance, and sin prevents us from living in His presence. Only through the Savior’s grace and mercy can we become clean from sin so that we can live with God again. This is possible through exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203549" id="p17">
      To fulfill the plan of salvation, Christ paid the penalty for our sins. He alone was able to do that. He was called and prepared in the premortal life. He was the literal Son of God in
      <span class="page-break" data-page="52"></span>the flesh. He was sinless and completely obedient to His Father. Though tempted, He never gave in to temptation. When the Father asked His Beloved Son to pay the price of the world’s sins, Jesus was prepared and willing. The Savior’s Atonement included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and His suffering and death on the cross, and it ended with His Resurrection. Though He suffered beyond comprehension—so much so that He bled from every pore and asked whether it were possible that this burden be lifted from Him—He submitted to the Father’s will in a supreme expression of love for His Father and for us. This triumph of Jesus Christ over spiritual death by His suffering and over physical death by His Resurrection is called the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203551" id="p18">Christ promises to forgive our sins on the condition that we accept Him by exercising faith in Him, repenting, receiving baptism by immersion and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and striving faithfully to keep His commandments to the end of our lives. Through continuing repentance, we may obtain forgiveness and be cleansed of our sins by the power of the Holy Ghost. We are relieved of the burden of guilt and shame, and through Jesus Christ we become worthy to return to the presence of God.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203553" id="p19">As we rely on the Atonement of Jesus Christ, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203555" id="p20">In paying the penalty for our sins, Jesus did not, however, eliminate our personal responsibility. We must show that we accept Him and that we will follow His commandments. Only through the gift of the Savior’s Atonement can we return to live with God.</p>

    <p data-aid="128203615" id="p21">Even though Christ conquered physical death, all people must die, for death is part of the process by which we are transformed from mortality to immortality. At death our spirits go to the spirit world. Death does not change our personality or our desires for good or evil. Those who chose to obey God in this life live in a state of happiness, peace, and rest from troubles and care. Those who chose not to obey in this life and did not repent live in a state of unhappiness. In the spirit world the gospel is preached to those who did not obey the gospel or have the opportunity to hear it while on earth. We remain in the spirit world until we are resurrected.</p>

      <p data-aid="137163649" id="p70">Exaltation, or celestial glory, is the highest state of happiness and glory in the celestial kingdom. Exaltation is a conditional gift. President Nelson has taught, “Those qualifying conditions include faith in the Lord, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and remaining faithful to the ordinances and covenants of the temple” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2008/04/salvation-and-exaltation?lang=eng&amp;para=p22#p22">Salvation and Exaltation</a>,” 9). Exaltation means living with God forever in eternal families. It is to know God and Jesus Christ and to experience the life They enjoy.</p>

      <p data-aid="128203643" id="figure10_p1">Some people may confuse the doctrine of Resurrection with the concept of reincarnation. The human teaching of reincarnation, that we are born into the world again in a different form, is not true or scriptural. The doctrine of Resurrection involves receiving an eternal reward of an immortal body of flesh and bone. This is true doctrine. Make sure those you teach clearly understand the doctrine of the Resurrection.</p>

      <p data-aid="137163663" id="figure17_p1">Scripture study, church attendance, and prayer can help people feel God’s love and recognize truth through the witness of the Holy Ghost. Encourage those you teach to include these practices as they learn about the plan of salvation and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. (See the “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-4-the-commandments?lang=eng#title5">Pray Often</a>” section in Lesson 4 for guidance on how you might help someone learn how to pray and read the scriptures.) When they consistently study the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon; attend church regularly; and pray to God with faith, sincerity, and real intent (with a commitment to act upon the answers received), God will answer their prayers, guide their lives, and help them discern truth.</p>

It maps our eternal journey through premortal life, mortal life, death, resurrection, and to our life in the eternities. The plan also explains what our loving Father in Heaven does to help us make this journey successfully so that we can return to His presence and become like Him. The plan focuses on the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ in overcoming the effects of the Fall and making eternal life and exaltation possible for us.

      <p data-aid="128203755" id="figure15_p1">Our message helps us understand the purpose of life and who we are. It gives us hope and helps us find peace, joy, and happiness. It tells us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life. God is our Father, and He loves us. We are His children. We are part of His family, and we lived with Him before we were born on this earth. He has a plan of happiness that makes it possible for us to return to His presence after this life. Our progress depends on how we use our God-given agency, or ability to choose. As part of that plan, the Fall of Adam and Eve made it possible for us to come to earth, gain a physical body, have experience, and have families of our own. But the Fall also brought physical death, which is separation of the spirit from the body, and spiritual death, which is separation from God.</p>
      <p data-aid="128203757" id="figure15_p2"><span class="page-break" data-page="56"></span>Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan. Christ’s atoning sacrifice overcame the effects of both physical and spiritual death. We will all be resurrected and will live forever with physical bodies free of pain and sickness. Christ also made it possible to overcome spiritual death. As we live His gospel He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life.</p>
      <p data-aid="128203759" id="figure15_p3">As part of God’s merciful plan, we will all suffer a physical death. Our spirits will be separated from our bodies and will live for a time in the spirit world. We will then be resurrected with an immortal body, an eternal union of our body and spirit. We will be judged according to our works and desires. Those who have lived the gospel will receive our Father in Heaven’s greatest gift, the gift of exaltation—to live as a family in His presence.</p>
      <p data-aid="128203761" id="figure15_p4">Our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love to reveal His plan of happiness. We learn about this wonderful plan in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. We invite you to attend church and worship with us.</p>

      </header>
      <p data-aid="128203880" id="p31">Following are terms that are frequently not understood. Make sure you explain them clearly and find out if those you are teaching understand.</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203882" id="p32"><strong>Atonement of Jesus Christ:</strong> As used in the scriptures, to atone is to suffer the penalty for an act of sin, thereby removing the effects of sin from the repentant sinners and allowing them to be reconciled to God. Jesus Christ suffered in Gethsemane and on the cross. He was the only one capable of making a perfect Atonement for all mankind. He suffered the penalty for our sins in Gethsemane and died on the cross. He took upon Himself the pains, sicknesses, temptations, afflictions, and infirmities of us all (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12?lang=eng#p11">Alma 7:11–12</a>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203884" id="p33"><strong>Exaltation:</strong> To become like our Father in Heaven and live in His presence as members of His family. President Nelson has taught, “To be exalted—or to gain exaltation—refers to the highest state of happiness and glory in the celestial realm” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2008/04/salvation-and-exaltation?lang=eng&amp;para=p13#p13">Salvation and Exaltation</a>,” 8). Exaltation comes through the Atonement of Christ and through obedience to all the laws and ordinances of the gospel.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203886" id="p34"><strong>Fall (of Adam and Eve):</strong> When Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, they became mortal—that is, subject to sin and death. Adam became the “first flesh” upon the earth (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.7?lang=eng#p7">Moses 3:7</a>). Latter-day revelation makes clear that the Fall is a blessing and that Adam and Eve should be honored as the first parents of all mankind.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203890" id="p36"><strong>Immortality:</strong> The condition of living forever in a resurrected state, not subject to physical death.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203888" id="p35"><strong>Judgment:</strong> God, through Jesus Christ, will judge us individually to determine the eternal glory we will receive. This judgment will be based on our obedience to God’s commandments, including our acceptance of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. We will receive our eternal reward based on whether our works and desires have been good or evil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203892" id="p37"><strong>Mortality:</strong> The time from birth until physical death.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203894" id="p38"><strong>Physical death:</strong> Separation of our spirit, which lives forever and cannot die, from our physical body.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203896" id="p39">
            <strong>Premortal life (premortal existence; pre-earth life):</strong>
            As spirit children of our Father in Heaven, we lived in His presence before we were born on this earth. In premortal life we did not have physical bodies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203898" id="p40"><strong>Redemption:</strong> To deliver, to purchase, or to ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment. Redemption refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin. Jesus’s Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death. Through His Atonement, those who have faith in Him and repent are also redeemed from spiritual death.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203900" id="p41"><strong>Resurrection:</strong> The reuniting of the spirit body with the physical body of flesh and bones after death. After resurrection, the spirit and body will never again be separated, and the person is immortal. Every person born on earth will be resurrected because Jesus Christ overcame death.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203902" id="p42"><strong>Salvation:</strong> To be saved from physical and spiritual death. “We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression; … that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.2-3?lang=eng#p2">Articles of Faith 1:2–3</a>). All people will be saved from physical death, or resurrected, by the grace of God, through the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is an unconditional gift from the Savior to all human beings, regardless of the choices they make during this life. Salvation from spiritual death (sin) is conditional. President Russell M. Nelson taught, “People may also be saved from individual spiritual death through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, by their faith in Him, by living in obedience to the laws and ordinances of His gospel, and by serving Him” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2008/04/salvation-and-exaltation?lang=eng&amp;para=p12#p12">Salvation and Exaltation</a>,” 8).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128203904" id="p43"><strong>Spiritual death:</strong> Separation from God and His influences; to die as to things pertaining to righteousness. Spiritual death was introduced into the world by the Fall of Adam and Eve (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.6-7?lang=eng#p6">Alma 42:6–7</a>). Mortals with sinful thoughts, words, and works are spiritually dead while still alive on earth (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.39?lang=eng#p39">2 Nephi 9:39</a>). Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, men and women can become clean from sin and overcome spiritual death as they repent and live the principles and ordinances of the gospel (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.2-3?lang=eng#p2">Articles of Faith 1:2–3</a>).</p>

      God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, into the world so that all of God’s children would have the possibility of experiencing joy and peace in this world and everlasting life in the world to come with their families. Additionally, through Jesus Christ all God’s children will live again when their bodies and spirits are reunited in the Resurrection (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.40-42?lang=eng#p40">Doctrine and Covenants 76:40–42</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="137163623" id="p53">As the result of Adam and Eve’s transgression, death is experienced by all people. And because all people have made mistakes and sinned, they are unable to return to live with God because “no unclean thing can dwell” in His presence (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.21?lang=eng#p21">1 Nephi 10:21</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="137163625" id="p54">
      However, through the Savior’s grace and mercy we will live again as resurrected beings and can be clean from sin so that we can live in our Heavenly Father’s presence. Becoming clean from sin is being healed spiritually (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.13?lang=eng#p13">3 Nephi 9:13</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.32?lang=eng#p32">18:32</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128201413" id="p2">
      Because of the Savior’s sacrifice, known as the Atonement of Christ, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see

Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.21?lang=eng#p21">1 Nephi 10:21</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.19?lang=eng#p19">3 Nephi 27:19</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.57?lang=eng#p57">Moses 6:57</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128201415" id="p4">The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201416" id="p5">However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. Through Jesus Christ’s Atonement and living the gospel we can enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by doing His will and keeping His commandments, including obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Nephi refers to these principles and ordinances as “the doctrine of Christ” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.2?lang=eng#p2">2 Nephi 31:2</a>–<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.1-6?lang=eng#p1">32:6</a>).</p>

      <p data-aid="128201418" id="figure2_p1">The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss your past transgressions or ask those you teach to discuss their past transgressions.</p>

    <p data-aid="137163631" id="p55">
      The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.12?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 42:12</a>). It also contains the clearest presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, sometimes referred to as the doctrine of Christ, found anywhere in scripture.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="137163634" id="p56">
      According to the Book of Mormon the gospel of Jesus Christ includes five key points: (1) faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) repentance through the Atonement of Christ; (3) baptism by immersion in Christ’s name; (4) the gift of the Holy Ghost; and (5) enduring to the end (see

    </p>
    <p data-aid="137163636" id="p57">
      Additionally, the Book of Mormon teaches us what we must believe about Christ in order to have faith in Him (see

    <p data-aid="128203524" id="p6">The gospel of Jesus Christ begins with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. It is to believe there is no “salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/acts/4.12?lang=eng#p12">Acts 4:12</a>). There are other things that we need to believe if we are to have faith in Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.13-15?lang=eng#p13">3 Nephi 27:13–15</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="137163638" id="p58">We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. We can develop faith in Christ through humility and doing His will and keeping His commandments. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to listen to and obey His Son.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203526" id="p7">
      Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting change. Having faith causes us to try as
      <span class="page-break" data-page="62"></span>hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior with “unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.19?lang=eng#p19">2 Nephi 31:19</a>). We want to learn His will and keep His commandments. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving through the power of Christ’s Atonement to keep His commandments and avoid sin.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203528" id="p8">
      We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/7.17?lang=eng#p17">John 7:17</a>). We also grow in faith by hearing and reading the word of God (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/rom/10.17?lang=eng#p17">Romans 10:17</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Helaman 15:7–8</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203530" id="p9">As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128203575" id="p10">Repentance through the Atonement of Jesus Christ is another important principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow and return to Him with full purpose of heart. We stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance and faith on Jesus Christ is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s grace and mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy on the condition of repentance.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203577" id="p11">To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who will support us as we truly repent. We ask God to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away from our sins and do them no more. We resist any desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203579" id="p12">Sincere repentance brings several results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203581" id="p13"><span class="page-break" data-page="63"></span>Even after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these transgressions, remembering we “can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth” us (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13?lang=eng#p13">Philippians 4:13</a>). In addition, we should continually improve—develop Christlike qualities, grow in knowledge, and serve more effectively. As we learn more about what the Savior wants for us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him. Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily.</p>

    <p data-aid="128203618" id="p14">Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203620" id="p15">God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and His children. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203622" id="p16">Covenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our promises to God. We should desire to worthily receive the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives, relying upon Jesus Christ. By loving the Lord, keeping His commandments, and loving and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins through “him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/rev/1.5?lang=eng#p5">Revelation 1:5</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128203624" id="p17">Covenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority in the name of Jesus Christ. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203626" id="p18"><span class="page-break" data-page="64"></span>Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.20?lang=eng#p20">Doctrine and Covenants 84:20</a>). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized by the Lord’s authorized servant. Christ set the example for us by being baptized.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203628" id="p19">
      Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and Resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Mosiah 5:7–8</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8.14-17?lang=eng#p14">Romans 8:14–17</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203630" id="p20">
      We must be baptized to become members of His kingdom on earth, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority and in His name (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28.19-20?lang=eng#p19">Matthew 28:19–20</a>). A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203632" id="p21">
      Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.4-24?lang=eng#p4">Moroni 8:4–24</a>). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.27?lang=eng#p27">Doctrine and Covenants 68:27</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203634" id="p22">Before baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the commandments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenant. We also regularly renew the covenant we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenant. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us.</p>

        Ensure that those you teach have developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions by relying upon the sacrifice of the Savior, and made sufficient changes in their lives to qualify as commanded in
        <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>. Those you teach “must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men [and women]” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#p20">2 Nephi 31:20</a>). Additionally, they must promise to live the principles of moral worthiness, obey the Word of Wisdom, and obey the law of tithing. If you feel additional preparation is needed, you should postpone baptism until those you teach meet the standard outlined by the Lord in scripture. (See “Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, Dec. 11, 2002.)

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128203711" id="p23">
      Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of fire and of the Spirit or it is incomplete (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13-14?lang=eng#p13">2 Nephi 31:13–14</a>). Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203713" id="p24">The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. Through the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, we can receive and retain a remission of sins through continued faith in Christ, repentance, and following the will of God and obedience to His commandments.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203715" id="p25">Those who receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and remain worthy can enjoy His companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life and exaltation.</p>
    <p data-aid="137163641" id="p59">After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203717" id="p26">The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through the death of the Savior’s Apostles, was restored through angelic administration to a modern prophet, Joseph Smith. Only through membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the right to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion. This authority makes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.30?lang=eng#p30">Doctrine and Covenants 1:30</a>).</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="137163645" id="p60">The gospel of Jesus Christ includes obtaining and increasing our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting of our sins through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, being baptized by immersion by an authorized servant of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ, receiving baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and enduring to the end.</p>
    <p data-aid="137163647" id="p61">Enduring to the end does not simply mean holding on until we die. Enduring to the end includes obtaining Christlike attributes through the Savior’s Atonement. Enduring to the end includes following the Father’s will and obeying His commandments, fasting, prayer, scripture study, observing the Sabbath day, repenting, and making and keeping sacred temple covenants.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203766" id="p27">Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the path. We do so by continually exercising faith in and relying upon Jesus Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203768" id="p28">Once we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.”</p>
    <p data-aid="128203770" id="p29">
      By following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for exaltation (see
      <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-2-the-plan-of-salvation?lang=eng&amp;para=title8#title8">page 53</a>
      for additional information regarding the difference between salvation and exaltation).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203772" id="p30">Faith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ … and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” and exaltation (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#p20">2 Nephi 31:20</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.17?lang=eng#p17">Doctrine and Covenants 132:17</a>).</p>

The first principles and ordinances of His gospel are faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We must then endure to the end. By applying these principles throughout our lives, we follow the example of the Savior, learn to live His commandments, and develop Christlike attributes. We can be forgiven of our sins, and we will be able to return to live in the presence of our Father in Heaven.</p>

      <p data-aid="128203836" id="figure13_p1">Our message is one of faith and hope. We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to have exaltation in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life.</p>
      <p data-aid="128203838" id="figure13_p2">
        The gospel of Jesus Christ is simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know the truth. We can know in our hearts
        <span class="page-break" data-page="68"></span>and our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive throughout our lives to please the Lord.
      </p>
      <p data-aid="128203840" id="figure13_p3">Jesus Christ has restored His gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

          <p data-aid="128203950" id="p39"><strong>Covenant:</strong> An agreement between God and His children. We do not act as equals in the agreement. God gives the conditions for the covenant, and we agree to do what He asks us to do. God then promises us certain blessings for our obedience. We receive ordinances by covenant. When we make such covenants, we promise to honor them. For example, members of the Church covenant with the Lord at baptism and renew that covenant by partaking of the sacrament. We make further covenants in the temple. The Lord’s people are a covenant people. We are greatly blessed as we keep our covenants with the Lord.</p>

      Your purpose in teaching the commandments is to help people live the gospel by exercising faith in Jesus Christ and repenting as they prepare for baptism and confirmation and to help them remain faithful after baptism. Help those you teach understand that enduring to the end includes keeping the commandments of God. By obeying the commandments, people will grow in their testimony of the gospel, show that they have “broken hearts and contrite spirits,” and begin to repent of all their sins (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.1-4?lang=eng#p1">Moroni 6:1–4</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128201589" id="p2">This lesson is organized differently from the first three. The first three lessons explain the doctrinal foundation for the gospel of Jesus Christ. This lesson explains specific commandments God has given that help us apply gospel principles in our lives.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201591" id="p3">There are many ways to teach this lesson. The approach you take should be determined by the needs, interests, and situation of the people you teach and the direction of the Spirit. Prayerfully decide what to teach and which invitations to extend. Be mindful of the questions and level of understanding of those you teach.</p>
    <p data-aid="137202557" id="p62">Constantly think and pray about how to help them live the gospel. Ideas include:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128201594" id="p4">
          Teaching one or more commandments as part of another lesson. When doing so, consider the principle taught in
          <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.32?lang=eng#p32">Alma 12:32</a>: “God gave unto them commandments, <em>after</em> having made known unto them the plan of redemption” (italics added). Certain commandments, such as prayer and scripture study, might be taught best as part of the first three lessons. Other commandments might be best taught after you have laid the doctrinal foundation of the gospel found in the first three lessons.

        <p data-aid="128201601" id="p7">Teaching the commandments in the context of the gospel. Briefly review the lesson on the gospel of Jesus Christ before teaching one or more of the commandments. As you do so, you can help people see how the commandments fit into the larger picture of exercising faith in the Savior and repenting in preparation for baptism and confirmation. Their lives can be blessed as they see the gospel of Jesus Christ as a pattern for living.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128201603" id="p8">You may be able to teach some people in a few visits; others may require more visits. You have the flexibility to teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201606" id="p9">Rarely should a lesson go over 45 minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering smaller portions of material.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201608" id="p10">There are many ways you may approach teaching this lesson. Which commandment you teach, when you teach it, and how much time you give to it is best determined by the needs of the people you teach and the direction of the Spirit.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128201664" id="p17">God commands us to pray to Him. You can pray at any time and in any setting. The Lord has taught us to kneel and pray in the morning and in the evening, as individuals and with our families. Our Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. Through daily prayer we receive divine guidance and blessings. We should always pray sincerely. We should also pray with “real intent,” which means we are committed to act on the answer that we receive.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201666" id="p18">
      We pray with faith to our Father in Heaven in the name of Jesus Christ (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.8?lang=eng#p8">Moses 5:8</a>). Because He is our Father and we are His children, He will answer our prayers. We begin our prayers by addressing our Father in Heaven. We end our prayers by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.”
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128201669" id="p19">In prayer we speak openly and honestly with our loving Father in Heaven. We express gratitude and thanksgiving for our blessings. We may acknowledge our love for Him. We also ask for help, protection, and direction according to our needs.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201671" id="p20">As we pray with faith, sincerity, and real intent, we will see God’s influence in our lives. He will guide us in our daily lives and help us make good decisions. He will bless us with feelings of comfort and peace. He will warn us of danger and strengthen us to resist temptation. He will forgive our sins. We will feel closer to Him. We must learn to recognize His influence in our lives. We must learn to listen to the still, small voice of the Spirit.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201674" id="p21">We can recognize when the Holy Ghost is teaching us the truth. Our minds will be filled with inspiring and uplifting thoughts. We will be enlightened, or given new knowledge. Our hearts will have feelings of peace, joy, and love. We will want to do good and be helpful to others. These feelings are hard to describe but can be recognized as we experience them.</p>

    <p data-aid="128201689" id="p22">The scriptures are written records of God’s dealings with His children as recorded by prophets under the guidance of the Holy Ghost. We show our faith by studying, believing, and obeying God’s revealed word. We diligently search the scriptures to understand the truth. We feast upon them because they open the door to revelation and show us what we need to do and become. We search the scriptures to learn about Jesus Christ and His gospel. Faith in Jesus Christ is a gift from God and comes through studying and living His word and His gospel. The approved scriptures of the Church, also called the standard works, are the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. We should study these sacred books, especially the Book of Mormon, daily. The Book of Mormon testifies of Jesus Christ and the truthfulness of His doctrine.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128201705" id="p23">Keeping the Sabbath day holy is a commandment. God declared, “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/ex/20.8?lang=eng#p8">Exodus 20:8</a>). Our Sabbath-day behavior is a reflection of our commitment to honor and worship God. By keeping the Sabbath day holy, we show God our willingness to keep our covenants. Each Sabbath day we go to church to worship Him. While at church, members of the Church partake of the sacrament to remember Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Partaking of the sacrament allows us to renew our covenants and show that we are willing to repent of our sins and mistakes.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201706" id="p24">On the Sabbath day, we enjoy a rest from our labors. As we attend Church services and worship together, we strengthen each other. We are renewed by our association with friends and family. Our faith is strengthened as we study the scriptures and learn more about the restored gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201707" id="p25">When a community or nation grows careless in its Sabbath activities, its religious life decays and all aspects of life are negatively affected. The blessings associated with keeping the Sabbath day holy are withheld. We should refrain from shopping on the Sabbath and participating in other commercial and sporting activities that make the Sabbath feel common.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201708" id="p26">
      Instead, we should set this holy day apart from activities of the world by entering into a spirit of worship, thanksgiving, service, and activities with family and friends that are appropriate to the Sabbath. As Church members endeavor to make their Sabbath activities compatible with the intent and Spirit of the Lord, their lives will be filled with joy and peace. When we keep the Sabbath day holy, it becomes “a delight” (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/isa/58.13-14?lang=eng#p13">Isaiah 58:13–14</a>), a time of spiritual refreshment (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/ex/31.17?lang=eng#p17">Exodus 31:17</a>), and a sign of our love for and devotion to our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer.

      The way we show our desire to follow in God’s way is through baptism and confirmation. When we are baptized and confirmed, we enter into a covenant with God that we will take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and that we will always remember Him and keep His commandments.

    <p data-aid="128201733" id="p28">Truth is a knowledge of things as they really are, were, and will be. It does not change with conditions or time. Truth is the same in every age and culture. God is the source of all truth. We can have faith in Him because we know He will teach us only truth. God wants all His children to know the truth. Therefore, He reveals the truths necessary for salvation through prophets and apostles. He reveals truth to us personally through the scriptures and personal revelation.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201734" id="p29">A prophet is called and chosen by God and is a righteous man with great faith. The Lord reveals truth to him through the Holy Ghost. He commands His prophet to teach truth to all people. Those who believe God’s words as revealed through His prophet are blessed.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201735" id="p30">Christ’s Church is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets, who direct the Church by revelation. The Lord called Joseph Smith as the first prophet and head of this last dispensation. His successors who lead The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today are also prophets and apostles. The President of the Church today is a living prophet. We are to have faith in God’s chosen prophet, gain conviction of his divine calling, and follow his teachings.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201736" id="p31">
      We have frequent opportunities to sustain Church leaders publicly. To
      <i>sustain</i> means to offer our support with thoughts, words, and actions. We are to prepare ourselves so that when the prophets and apostles speak, the Holy Ghost can confirm the truths they teach, and we can then determine to follow the counsel they give us.

    <p data-aid="128201737" id="p32">Those who listen to and follow the counsel of living prophets and apostles will not go astray. The teachings of living prophets provide an anchor of eternal truth in a world of shifting values and help us avoid misery and sorrow. The confusion and strife of the world will not overwhelm us, and we can enjoy the assurance of being in harmony with God’s will.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128201781" id="p45">God delights in chastity. Chastity means limiting all sexual relations to one husband (for women) or one wife (for men). It also means strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one’s spouse after marriage. Those who live the law of chastity enjoy the strength that comes from self-control. They enjoy confidence and trust in their family relationships. They can enjoy more fully the influence of the Holy Ghost in their lives. Those who break this law are subject to a lasting sense of shame and guilt that burdens their lives.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201782" id="p46">Chastity requires faithfulness in thought and action. We must keep our thoughts clean and be modest in our dress, speech, and actions. We must avoid pornography in any form. We should treat the God-given procreative power and our bodies as sacred. Sexual relations are a God-given power to procreate and strengthen a married couple’s bond.</p>
    <p data-aid="137202558" id="p60">People who experience same-sex attraction should also keep the law of chastity and keep covenants with God. Experiencing same-sex attraction or identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual is not a sin and does not prohibit one from participating in the Church, holding callings, or attending the temple.</p>
    <p data-aid="137202559" id="p61">
      Baptismal candidates are to live the law of chastity, which prohibits any sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between one man and one woman. They are not to participate in abortions or homosexual relations. Because God loves all His children and reaches out to them in love through Jesus Christ (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/rom/5.8?lang=eng#p8">Romans 5:8</a>), those who have committed sexual sin can repent, be forgiven, and live after the manner of happiness (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.27?lang=eng#p27">2 Nephi 5:27</a>).

      <p data-aid="128201784" id="figure18_p1">Men and women who are living together but are not married may not be baptized without first getting married or separated. People in same-sex marriages or same-sex relationships, or those who are married to more than one person at a time, may not be baptized. The invitation to live the law of chastity may pose very difficult challenges to the people you are teaching. Be prayerful and sensitive to each person’s situation. Use caution and follow the promptings of the Spirit when discussing sexual behavior to avoid compromising situations or accusations. Seek counsel from your mission president, who will give you specific direction in each case.</p>

You may also want to encourage local Church leaders to access resources on the Church’s Provident Living website. The suggestions below are applied particularly to the Word of Wisdom but can be adapted for other addictions as well.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204823" id="p50">
      One of the great blessings of membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the privilege of contributing to the growth of the kingdom of God through paying tithing. Tithing is an ancient, divine law. For example, the Old Testament prophet Abraham paid tithes of all he possessed (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.15?lang=eng#p15">Alma 13:15</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204824" id="p51">To those who pay tithing, the Lord promises that He will “open … the windows of heaven, and pour … out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10?lang=eng#p10">Malachi 3:10</a>). These blessings may be temporal or spiritual, but they will come to those who obey this divine law.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204825" id="p52">
      Tithing means one-tenth, and the Lord has commanded us to give a tenth of our increase, which is understood to mean income, that we may be blessed. The law of tithing gives us the opportunity to help build His kingdom. Our tithes are holy to the Lord, and we honor Him by paying tithing. God promises to abundantly bless those who pay an honest tithe. Those who do not pay tithing rob God (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3.8?lang=eng#p8">Malachi 3:8</a>). They keep for themselves something that rightfully belongs to Him. We should seek first the kingdom of God, and tithing is an important way of doing that. Paying tithing is an expression of our faith. It is an outward sign of our belief in God and His work.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204826" id="p53">Tithing funds are used to support the ongoing activities of the Church, such as building and maintaining temples and meetinghouses, carrying the gospel to all the world, conducting temple and family history service, and many other worldwide activities. Tithing does not pay local Church leaders, who serve voluntarily without receiving payment of any kind.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204827" id="p54">Local Church leaders send the tithing received each week directly to Church headquarters. A council comprised of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric determines specific ways to use the sacred tithing funds.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204844" id="p55">Great blessings are available to those who obey God’s commandment to fast. Fasting means going without food and drink for a period of time. Usually the first Sunday of each month is set aside as a special day to fast for two consecutive meals, pray, and bear testimony. Fasting and prayer go together. When we fast and pray with faith, we are more receptive to receiving answers to our prayers and blessings from the Lord. He promises us that He will guide us continually. We should fast and pray for specific purposes. Fasting is private and spiritual, and we should not draw attention to the fact that we are fasting.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204845" id="p56">Pure religion includes caring for the poor. We are to help them meet their physical and spiritual needs. When we fast, we donate money to the Church for the care of the poor and the needy. We call this a fast offering. We give at least the amount of money we save by fasting for two meals. However, we need not limit our contribution to the cost of two meals. We are encouraged to be as generous as our means allow. By caring for the poor, we help fulfill our baptismal covenant and retain a remission of our sins.</p>

      </header>
      <p data-aid="128204868" id="p57">Tithes and offerings are paid voluntarily and privately. Members are encouraged to pay tithes as they receive their income. However, members who wish to pay annually may do so. Members may contribute fast-offering funds directly to a member of the bishopric or to an Aaronic Priesthood holder designated to receive fast-offering donations. Members make donations by completing a donation slip, which is obtained from the bishopric. (Tithing donations, as opposed to fast offerings, should be given only to a member of the bishopric.) The member keeps the yellow copy and seals the white copy and the donation in an envelope that is provided. The envelope is given to a member of the bishopric.

A member of the bishopric and a clerk keep a careful, confidential accounting of all donations.</p>

      This lesson works much like
      <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-4-the-commandments?lang=eng">lesson 4</a>. The approach you take should be determined by the needs, interests, and situations of the people you are teaching and direction from the Spirit. Constantly think and pray about how to help others live the gospel. Be mindful of the questions and level of understanding of those you teach. Ideas include:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128203975" id="p3">Teaching one or more of the laws and ordinances from this lesson while reviewing “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-1-the-message-of-the-restoration-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng">The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ</a>,” “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-2-the-plan-of-salvation?lang=eng">The Plan of Salvation</a>,” and “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-3-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng">The Gospel of Jesus Christ</a>” lessons. For example, while teaching the message of the Restoration you may want to teach about priesthood and missionary work; while teaching the plan of salvation you may teach about eternal marriage, temples and family history service, and teaching and learning in the Church. While teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ you may want to teach about the strait and narrow way and serving in the Church.</p>

      <li>
        <p data-aid="128203976" id="p4">Teaching two or three of the laws and ordinances as a single lesson.</p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128203978" id="p6">Work with members to help people you are teaching accept and begin living these laws and ordinances. Help people recognize that by keeping God’s laws, they will retain a remission of their sins and stay on the pathway to exaltation. They will experience greater peace and joy. They will find answers to life’s questions and security in the knowledge that they belong to the true Church of Jesus Christ. The laws and ordinances serve as directions for living joyfully, with faith in Jesus Christ and a firm hope of receiving exaltation with our Father in Heaven.</p>

      <h2 data-aid="128203984" id="title4"><span class="page-break" data-page="87"></span>Priesthood and Organizations</h2>
    </header>
    <p data-aid="128203985" id="p11">Priesthood is the power and authority given to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. Priesthood power blesses all of us. Through the priesthood, women and men receive the ordinances of salvation, as well as the blessings of healing, comfort, and counsel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203986" id="p12">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is led by Jesus Christ through apostles and prophets. These are righteous men who are called of God and given the priesthood. Anciently Christ ordained His Apostles and gave them the priesthood. That authority was lost when the people rejected the gospel and killed Christ and the Apostles.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203987" id="p13">
      Priesthood authority was restored in 1829 when John the Baptist appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. He laid his hands on their heads and conferred on them the Aaronic Priesthood (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/13?lang=eng">Doctrine and Covenants 13</a>). A short time later Peter, James, and John of the original Twelve Apostles laid their hands on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and conferred upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood, which Peter, James, and John had received from Jesus Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.12-13?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 27:12–13</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203988" id="p14">
      A man can receive priesthood authority only by proper ordination by the laying on of hands by one who has the authority. A man who receives the priesthood is given a marvelous opportunity. He enters a covenant to fulfill sacred duties, serve others, and help build up the Church. He must have a desire to serve God and must be ordained to this power (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.3?lang=eng#p3">Doctrine and Covenants 4:3</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.57?lang=eng#p57">63:57</a>). It is also necessary for priesthood holders to perform sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation. When priesthood authority is used worthily, the power of God is manifest. Priesthood power can be used only in righteousness, love, and patience.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="137171685" id="p32">How does this apply to women? President Dallin H. Oaks taught that women who are set apart as missionaries, officers, or teachers in the Church are “given priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2014/04/the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng&amp;para=p11-16#p11">The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> May 2014, 51).</p>
    <p data-aid="128203989" id="p15">All priesthood comes from God. There are two priesthoods in the Church: the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. The Aaronic Priesthood administers ordinances such as baptism and the sacrament. Worthy males of the appropriate age receive the Aaronic Priesthood soon after baptism and confirmation.</p>
    <p data-aid="128203990" id="p16">Worthy adult males will eventually receive the Melchizedek, or higher, Priesthood. Members of the Church receive many spiritual and temporal blessings through the power of this priesthood. Worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holders can confer the gift of the Holy Ghost, ordain others to the priesthood as assigned, anoint the sick with consecrated oil, and give blessings of healing and comfort. Worthy husbands and fathers who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood can give their spouses, children, and other family members special blessings. Ministering brothers care for individuals and families in the households of Church members. Ministering sisters care for other women in the Church. Bishops and stake presidents are judges in the Church. They have the authority to help Saints who have sinned to repent and enjoy the full blessings of Church membership. They interview people to ensure their worthiness to enter the temple.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171686" id="p33">
      In an address to the Relief Society, President Joseph Fielding Smith taught: “While the sisters have not been given the Priesthood, it has not been conferred upon them, that does not mean that the Lord has not given unto them authority. … A [man] may have authority given to him, or a sister to her, to do certain things in the Church that are binding and absolutely necessary for our salvation, such as the work that our sisters do in the House
      <span class="page-break" data-page="88"></span>of the Lord. They have authority given unto them to do some great and wonderful things, sacred unto the Lord, and binding just as thoroughly as are the blessings that are given by the men who hold the Priesthood” (Joseph Fielding Smith, “Relief Society—an Aid to the Priesthood,” <cite>Relief Society Magazine,</cite> Jan. 1959, 4).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128203991" id="p17">Church organizations are organized by priesthood authority to assist in strengthening members. Both men and women are a great resource in missionary work as they assist in finding, teaching, and fellowshipping new converts. The Relief Society, which includes women ages 18 and over, reaches out in service to families, individuals, and the community. Young women ages 11 to 18 are members of the Young Women program. Boys of similar ages participate in the Young Men program. All children ages 3 to 11 are part of the Primary organization. All members age 11 and older are enrolled in Sunday School classes.</p>

    <p data-aid="128204007" id="p18">Members who share the gospel experience joy and have the Spirit of the Lord more abundantly. As we share the gospel, we appreciate how precious and meaningful it is to us, and we feel a greater love for God and others. The Lord commanded His followers to preach the gospel in all the world, giving every person the opportunity to accept or reject it. When people are baptized, they make a covenant to always stand as witnesses of God. They are commanded to share the gospel with those who have not yet received it. As they live the gospel faithfully, they will set an example, showing their family members and friends the great blessings that come from living the gospel. They should also take advantage of opportunities to answer questions, share printed materials or digital media, and invite others to learn more about the message of the restored gospel. Members should pray for those who are not members of the Church. They should pray for missionary opportunities—to serve those who are not of our faith and share what they believe. The Lord promises to help members know what to say and do as they share the gospel.</p>

      <h2 data-aid="128204022" id="title6">Eternal Marriage</h2>
    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204023" id="p19">The basic unit of the Church is the family. Within the family, people experience many of life’s greatest joys and sorrows. Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and is central to God’s eternal plan for the salvation of His children. The means by which mortal life is created is divinely appointed and is safeguarded by marriage. The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to endure beyond the grave. Marriage, however, can be eternal only when authorized priesthood holders perform the sealing ordinance in sacred temples and when husbands and wives who have been sealed together keep the covenants they have made. Husbands and wives are to love each other. As they keep the commandments and live gospel principles, they are to honor their marital vows with complete fidelity (see “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&amp;para=p3-7#p3">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> May 2017, 145; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.22?lang=eng#p22">Doctrine and Covenants 42:22</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204024" id="p20">Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ and when parents make their family their highest priority. “By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&amp;para=p7#p7">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>,” 145). Together, parents are to teach their children the gospel of Jesus Christ and help them live it.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204025" id="p21">Satan is making a concentrated attack on families. Years ago Church leaders set aside one evening a week as a time for home evening. Parents should use this time to teach their children the gospel, strengthen their relationships with them, and have fun together. Other ways of strengthening the family include daily family prayer and scripture study, worshipping at church as a family, doing family history, and serving others. Heaven is a continuation of the ideal family. Through priesthood ordinances and righteous living, we can live as families in God’s presence eternally.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204055" id="p22">God has commanded His people to build temples. In the temple we make sacred covenants and are endowed with, or are given, a gift of power and knowledge from on high. This power helps us in our daily lives and enables us to build God’s kingdom. In the temple we can also be married for time and eternity, thus making it possible for families to be together forever in God’s presence. After at least one year of membership, worthy adults may be eligible to receive from their bishop a recommend to receive their own endowment. After receiving their endowments, married couples may be sealed or married for eternity.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204056" id="p23">The Savior loves all people and desires their salvation. Yet millions of people have died without having any opportunity to hear the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ or receive saving ordinances. Through His loving grace and mercy the Lord makes salvation possible for everyone who did not have the opportunity to receive, understand, and obey the gospel during their mortal lives. The gospel is preached to these deceased people in the spirit world. Members of the Church on earth perform the saving ordinances in behalf of their deceased ancestors and others. Deceased persons living in the spirit world have the opportunity to accept or reject the gospel and the ordinances performed in their behalf.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204057" id="p24">For this reason, Church members search for information about their ancestors. They can then add the information they find to the Church’s database at FamilySearch.org. A person can do so either on their own or with the help of a temple and family history consultant. The Church’s database then allows Church members to share or print out and take to the temple the names of deceased relatives who need to have saving ordinances performed on their behalf in sacred temples. This is an important aspect of doing family history. Worthy members of the appropriate age, including new members, are eligible to receive from their bishop a limited-use recommend to participate in performing baptisms and confirmations for these deceased ancestors.</p>

They can help those people identify their deceased relatives who are in need of temple ordinances. Where possible, go with new members to the temple. Participate with them in performing temple ordinances.</p>

      One of the great blessings of membership in the Church is the opportunity to serve. When we give loving service to others, we are serving God. When we are baptized, we covenant to give such service (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-10?lang=eng#p8">Mosiah 18:8–10</a>). We are to become aware of others’ physical and spiritual needs. We then give of our time, talents, and means to help meet those needs. We follow the example of the Savior, who came to serve others. We are to do what Jesus did and become like Him.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204077" id="p26">Soon after baptism new members receive from priesthood leaders the blessing of a responsibility to help in the Church. This is referred to as a calling. All of the work in the Church is voluntary. No one is paid for such service. When we accept callings, we are sustained publicly in a Church meeting so that other members can acknowledge our calling and provide support. We are also set apart by a priesthood leader and given special blessings to help us fulfill our callings. The Church needs the talents and abilities of every member to fill a wide variety of callings. All callings are important and help build God’s kingdom. We are to accept such callings and work diligently to learn and fulfill our duties. As we do so, we grow in faith, develop new talents and a greater ability to serve, and receive numerous other blessings.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204078" id="p27">Sisters and priesthood holders may be given assignments to minister to others. As members minister, they determine through communication and inspiration the frequency and type of contact they have with those to whom they give care. Ministering brothers care for individuals and families in households. Ministering sisters represent the Relief Society by caring for each adult sister as assigned.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171687" id="p34">
      Some opportunities to care for those in need come through Church callings. Other opportunities are present in members’ homes, neighborhoods, and communities, such as those coordinated by JustServe (where it is approved). Members can also help the poor
      <span class="page-break" data-page="92"></span>and needy of all faiths throughout the world by supporting the Church’s humanitarian efforts, by participating in disaster response, and by giving individual efforts to serve others in need.

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204125" id="p29">As we continue to live the gospel, we grow closer to our Heavenly Father. We enjoy and appreciate more the Atonement of the Savior. Our families are drawn closer together. We experience greater feelings of the love, joy, and peace that come from following the Savior and applying His Atonement. Our hearts are changed, and we find security in living the restored gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204127" id="p30"><span class="page-break" data-page="93"></span>As we continue to exercise faith in Christ, repent, and renew our covenants, we enjoy continued guidance from the Holy Ghost. If we endure to the end of our lives in being true to our covenants, we will receive exaltation.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171688" id="p35">President Russell M. Nelson taught: “Keep on the covenant path. … Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants will open the door to every spiritual privilege and blessing available to men, women, and children everywhere. … The end for which each of us strives is to be endowed with a power in a house of the Lord, sealed as families—faithful to the covenants made in a temple that qualify us for the greatest gift of God, that of eternal life” (live telecast from the annex of the Salt Lake Temple, Jan. 16, 2018).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204129" id="p31">A few members do not endure or remain fully active. However, enduring to the end is a personal responsibility. We “work out [our] own salvation” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/philip/2.12?lang=eng#p12">Philippians 2:12</a>), and we serve and love those whose faith has grown weak through inactivity.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200735" id="p1">Joseph Smith said, “Salvation cannot come without revelation; it is in vain for anyone to minister without it” (Discourse, between circa 26 June and circa 4 August 1839-A, as reported by Willard Richards, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City). You will succeed in your work as you learn to receive and follow personal revelation. Joseph Smith also taught that revelation is vital for your daily work: “This is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the kingdom are placed” (History, 1838–1856, volume D-1 [1 August 1842–1 July 1843, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City]).</p>
    <p data-aid="128200736" id="p2">
      God loves you and all His children. He is anxious to support you in your practical and specific challenges. You have been promised inspiration to know what to do and have been given the power to do it (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.15-16?lang=eng#p15">Doctrine and Covenants 43:15–16</a>). He will help you as you try to recognize and understand the Spirit through diligent scripture study. He will guide you to people who will receive the message of the Restoration. He will give you power to deliver the message and to testify of Christ and His gospel. He will shower His blessings upon you through the gift of the Holy Ghost. He asks that you remain worthy of this gift and that you ask, seek, and knock (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.7?lang=eng#p7">Doctrine and Covenants 4:7</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Matthew 7:7–8</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128200737" id="p3">We live in the day prophesied by Book of Mormon prophets—a day when people will “contend one with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.4?lang=eng#p4">2 Nephi 28:4</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/29.6?lang=eng#p6">3 Nephi 29:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Mormon 9:7–8</a>). Yet many people also yearn for spiritual things. As you learn to receive personal revelation, you will teach with power and authority (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.3?lang=eng#p3">Alma 17:3</a>) because the Holy Ghost gives you power to speak (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.22?lang=eng#p22">1 Nephi 10:22</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128200738" id="p4">You need to seek and receive personal revelation through the Holy Ghost as you help people become baptized and confirmed. Have faith that you will receive personal revelation to guide you from day to day. The Holy Ghost will help you in every aspect of your work.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200748" id="p10"><strong>The power of the Holy Ghost.</strong> The witness that comes to sincere seekers of truth before baptism comes through the power of the Holy Ghost. “The power [of the Holy Ghost] can come upon one before baptism and is the convincing witness that the gospel is true.

      People who receive a witness but have not been baptized and confirmed do not yet have the promise of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Smith said: “There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him” (“Sabbath Scene in Nauvoo,”

To be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that the Holy Ghost confirms that righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants are acceptable to God. The Holy Spirit of Promise testifies to the Father that the saving ordinances have been performed properly and that the covenants associated with them have been kept. Those who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.51-60?lang=eng#p51">Doctrine and Covenants 76:51–60</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/eph/1.13-14?lang=eng#p13">Ephesians 1:13–14</a>).

      The gifts of the Spirit are special spiritual blessings that the Lord gives to worthy individuals for their own benefit and for their use in blessing others. For example, missionaries who must learn a new language may receive the gift of tongues to give them divine help in learning a language. Several gifts of the Spirit are described in
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.8-18?lang=eng#p8">Moroni 10:8–18</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.11-33?lang=eng#p11">Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–33</a>; and <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.1-12?lang=eng#p1">1 Corinthians 12:1–12</a>. These are only some examples of the many gifts of the Spirit. The Lord may bless you in other ways depending on your faithfulness, your needs, and the needs of those you serve.

    <p data-aid="128200802" id="p28">You can teach in the Lord’s way only by the power of the Spirit, and you receive the Spirit through the prayer of faith. The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14?lang=eng#p14">Doctrine and Covenants 42:14</a>). As you pray for help in your teaching, the power of the Holy Ghost will carry your teachings “unto the hearts of the children of men” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.1?lang=eng#p1">2 Nephi 33:1</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128200803" id="p29">President Gordon B. Hinckley illustrated this principle by relating an experience from his mission:</p>
    <p data-aid="128200804" id="p30">
      “I always remember two young men who served in my mission. One was a superstar. He was educated. He was bright. He was quick. He was a little arrogant. We had another who was a sign painter. He came from a sign shop with very little education, but he knew his inadequacies and he relied on the Lord. When he prayed, you knew he was talking with the Lord. It wasn’t a rote thing, it was a conversation and that young man accomplished wonders while the other young man went through the motions. The power that was in the one and the absence of power in the other was so apparent. Call upon the Lord. He has extended the invitation, and He will answer” (<cite>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</cite>
      [1997], 469).

    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200806" id="p32">
          Use the language of prayer, which shows that you love and respect your Heavenly Father. Use proper and respectful language in whatever language you speak. For example, in English use scriptural pronouns such as <i>Thee, Thou, Thy,</i> and

Pray for the welfare of those you are teaching, new converts, and returning members. Pray for the members and priesthood and auxiliary leaders in your area. Pray for your family at home. Pray for your companion, other missionaries, and your mission president. Pray to know how you can help others, and then be willing to sacrifice in their behalf.</p>

      <p data-aid="128200817" id="aside2_p1">“Every morning … , missionaries should get on their knees and plead with the Lord to loosen their tongues and speak through them to the blessing of those they will be teaching. If they will do this, a new light will come into their lives. There will be greater enthusiasm for the work. They will come to know that in a very real sense, they are servants of the Lord speaking in His behalf. They will find a different response from those they teach. As they do so by the Spirit, [the people they are teaching] will respond under the influence of the same Spirit.”</p>

        “The trouble with most of our prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceries—we place our order and hang up.

        “If prayer is only a spasmodic cry at the time of crisis, then it is utterly selfish, and we come to think of God as a repairman or a service agency to help us only in our emergencies. We should remember the Most High day and night—always—not only at times when all other assistance has failed and we desperately need help” (<cite>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Howard W.

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128201840" id="p43">The Spirit is always available to guide and direct you. However, the Spirit speaks quietly, through your feelings as well as your mind. One great challenge for you and those you work with is to recognize the quiet, subtle promptings of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201841" id="p44">President Boyd K. Packer taught: “The voice of the Spirit is described in the scripture as being neither ‘loud’ nor ‘harsh.’ It is ‘not a voice of thunder, neither … voice of a great tumultuous noise.’ But rather, ‘a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper,’ and it can ‘pierce even to the very soul’ and ‘cause [the heart] to burn.’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.3?lang=eng#p3">3 Ne. 11:3</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.30?lang=eng#p30">Hel. 5:30</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/85.6-7?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 85:6–7</a>.) Remember, Elijah found the voice of the Lord was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but was a ‘still small voice.’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.12?lang=eng#p12">1 Kgs. 19:12</a>.)</p>
    <p data-aid="128201842" id="p45">“The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all. …</p>
    <p data-aid="128201843" id="p46">“Occasionally it will press just firmly enough for us to pay heed. But most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come seeking and listening and say in our manner and expression, like Samuel of ancient times, ‘Speak [Lord], for thy servant heareth.’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/3.10?lang=eng#p10">1 Sam. 3:10</a>.)” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/ensign/1983/01/the-candle-of-the-lord?lang=eng&amp;para=p35#p35">The Candle of the Lord</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> Jan. 1983, 53).</p>
    <p data-aid="128201844" id="p47">Many voices in the world compete for your attention, and they can easily drown out spiritual impressions if you are not careful.</p>

      In answer to the question “How do we recognize the promptings of the Spirit?” President Gordon B. Hinckley read

      and then said: “That’s the test, when all is said and done. Does it persuade one to do good, to rise, to stand tall, to do the right thing, to be kind, to be generous? Then it is of the Spirit of God. …
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128201904" id="p49">“If it invites to do good, it is of God. If it inviteth to do evil, it is of the devil. … And if you are doing the right thing and if you are living the right way, you will know in your heart what the Spirit is saying to you.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201905" id="p50">
      “You recognize the promptings of the Spirit by the fruits of the Spirit—that which enlighteneth, that which buildeth up, that which is positive and affirmative and uplifting and leads us to better thoughts and better words and better deeds is of the Spirit of God” (<cite>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley,</cite>
      260–61).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128201906" id="p51">God answers your prayers through personal inspiration and revelation. Through the Holy Ghost He will guide you in your finding efforts, as you teach the restored gospel, and as you strengthen returning members and new converts. Your task is to live worthily, pray fervently, and learn to recognize and follow courageously the Spirit’s guidance.</p>

    <p data-aid="128201908" id="p52">As the Lord’s servant, you are to do His work in His way and by His power. Some missionaries feel confident that they know how to be successful. Others lack such confidence. Remember, however, that your confidence and faith should be in Christ, not in yourself. Rely on the Spirit rather than your own talents and abilities. Trust the Spirit to guide you in every aspect of your work. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Spirit is basic to teaching and preaching:</p>
    <p data-aid="128201909" id="p53">“No man can preach the Gospel without the Holy Ghost” (History, 1838–1856, volume B-1 [1 September 1834–2 November 1838], 756, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).</p>
    <p data-aid="128201910" id="p54">
      “Some few were called and ordained by the Spirit of revelation and prophecy, and began to preach as the Spirit gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they strengthened by the power of God” (Orson Pratt,
      <cite>A[n] Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions</cite>
      [Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840], 24).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128201911" id="p55">“[Joseph Smith] proceeded to give instruction to the Elders respecting preaching the Gospel, and pressed upon them the necessity of getting the Spirit, so that they might preach with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven” (History, 1838–1856, volume C-1 [2 November 1838–31 July 1842], 969, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).</p>
    <p data-aid="128201912" id="p56">During your weekly and daily planning sessions, you will need to ask some basic questions every day—even many times each day (see the “Scripture Study” box that follows for examples of questions). Seek inspiration to answer these questions in a way that meets each situation. The answers should then take shape in your plans. But you should also be willing to follow the Spirit and change your plans when unforeseen opportunities arise.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201913" id="p57">Study the following scriptures and consider how they answer these important questions that you should ask each day. Consider what these passages mean for your finding efforts, planning sessions, and personal and companion study. Also consider their meaning as you teach the lessons, invite people to make commitments, follow up on commitments, strengthen new members and returning members, and work with members.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128201957" id="p58">As you pray for inspiration, you should also confirm your feelings. For example, compare your decisions with the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets. Be certain that the feelings are consistent with the assignment you have; for example, you will not receive revelation to tell a local bishop how he should perform in his calling. Discuss your decisions and conclusions with your companion, your district leader, or your mission president when appropriate.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201958" id="p59">
      President Howard W. Hunter offered this counsel: “Let me offer a word of caution. … I think if we are not careful … , we may begin to try to counterfeit the true influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and manipulative means. I get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears are equated with the presence of the Spirit. Certainly the Spirit of the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the Spirit itself” (<cite>The Teachings of Howard W. Hunter</cite>
      [1997], 184). The Spirit of the Lord always edifies.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128201959" id="p60">Revelation and spiritual experiences are sacred. They should be kept private and discussed only in appropriate situations. As a missionary, you may be more aware of spiritual experiences than you have been earlier in your life. Resist the temptation to talk freely about these experiences.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201960" id="p61">President Boyd K. Packer counseled: “I have learned that strong, impressive spiritual experiences do not come to us very frequently. And when they do, they are generally for our own edification, instruction, or correction. Unless we are called by proper authority to do so, they do not position us to counsel or to correct others.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201961" id="p62">“I have come to believe also that it is not wise to continually talk of unusual spiritual experiences. They are to be guarded with care and shared only when the Spirit itself prompts you to use them to the blessing of others” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/ensign/1983/01/the-candle-of-the-lord?lang=eng&amp;para=p39#p39">The Candle of the Lord</a>,” 53).</p>

              “Tell the brethren to be humble and faithful and be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord, that it will lead them aright. Be careful and not turn away the still, small voice; it will teach them what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their heart open to conviction, so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them their hearts will be ready to receive it. They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits—it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts, and their whole desire will be to do good” (quoted in
              <cite>Juvenile Instructor,</cite> July 19, 1873, 114).

          <p data-aid="128202011" id="p91">Consider the following statement by President Dallin H. Oaks:</p>
          <p data-aid="128202012" id="p92">“[A person may have] a strong desire to be led by the Spirit of the Lord but … unwisely extends that desire to the point of wanting to be led in <em>all</em> things. A desire to be led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for our personal choices. Personal decision making is one of the sources of the growth we are meant to experience in mortality. Persons who try to shift all decision making to the Lord and plead for revelation in every choice will soon find circumstances in which they pray for guidance and don’t receive it. For example, this is likely to occur in those numerous circumstances in which the choices are trivial or either choice is acceptable.</p>
          <p data-aid="128202013" id="p93">“We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed within us. Then we should pray for guidance and act upon it if we receive it. If we do not receive guidance, we should act upon our best judgment. Persons who persist in seeking revelatory guidance on subjects on which the Lord has not chosen to direct us may concoct an answer out of their own fantasy or bias, or they may even receive an answer through the medium of false revelation” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/ensign/1994/10/our-strengths-can-become-our-downfall?lang=eng&amp;para=p16#p16">Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> Oct. 1994, 13–14).</p>

You can no more force the Spirit to respond than you can force a bean to sprout, or an egg to hatch before its time.

  <p data-aid="128204186" id="p1">The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It provides powerful evidence for the divinity of Christ. It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching.</p>

    <p data-aid="128204189" id="p2">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng">introduction to the Book of Mormon</a>). On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none” (Minutes and Discourse, 21 April 1834, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204190" id="p3">An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge-shaped pieces that lean against each other. The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and locks the other stones in place. When Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of Mormon holds our religion together. President Ezra Taft Benson said that the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways:</p>
    <p data-aid="128204191" id="p4"><strong>Witness of Christ.</strong> “The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.”</p>
    <p data-aid="128204192" id="p5"><strong>Fulness of doctrine.</strong> “The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9?lang=eng#p9">Doctrine and Covenants 20:9</a>[; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.5?lang=eng#p5">27:5</a>].) … In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of [the doctrine] required for our salvation.

      <strong>Foundation of testimony.</strong> “Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it” (<cite>A Witness and a Warning</cite>
      [1988], 18–19).

    <p data-aid="128204194" id="p7">
      The Book of Mormon is the most correct of any book on the earth (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng">introduction to the Book of Mormon</a>). It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons you teach people. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book of Mormon that you will teach to people.

      A central purpose of the Book of Mormon is to convince all people that Jesus is the Christ (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng">title page of the Book of Mormon</a>). It testifies of Christ by affirming the reality of His life, mission, and power. It teaches true doctrine concerning <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-3-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng#title2">Christ’s Atonement</a>—the foundation for the plan of salvation. Several of those whose writings are preserved in the Book of Mormon saw Christ personally. The brother of Jared, Nephi, and Jacob saw the premortal Christ. Mormon and Moroni saw the risen Christ. In addition, multitudes were present during the Savior’s brief but powerful ministry among the Nephites (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng">3 Nephi 11–28</a>). Those who know little or nothing about the Savior will come to know Him by reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204253" id="p9">The testimony of the Book of Mormon confirms the testimony of the Bible that Jesus is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior of the world. As you teach the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you will testify often about the Savior and Redeemer of the world. By the power of the Holy Ghost, you will add your living witness of the truthfulness of this message.</p>

      <h2 data-aid="128204299" id="title4">The Book of Mormon and the Bible Support Each Other</h2>
    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204301" id="p10">People’s beliefs about the Bible vary widely. Some believe that the Bible is absolutely perfect, without error, and that it is all we need to be saved. Others think the Bible is literature worth studying, but they deny that it is evidence of Christ’s divinity and miracles or direct revelation from God. Some choose to ignore the Bible, and others have never seen the Bible or had a chance to read it.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204303" id="p11">Latter-day Saints “believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.8?lang=eng#p8">Articles of Faith 1:8</a>). Far from competing with the Bible, the Book of Mormon supports it, exhorts us to read it, and testifies of the truthfulness of its message. You should use the Book of Mormon and the Bible to support one another.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204304" id="p12">The Book of Mormon speaks of the ancient covenants God made with His children; the Bible tells of great prophets who also received these covenants by faith. The Book of Mormon testifies of Christ and His Atonement; the Bible provides the account of His birth, ministry, death, Atonement, and Resurrection. Thus, the Bible and Book of Mormon complement and enrich each other.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204306" id="p13">
      The LDS English edition of the King James Version of the Bible and the Book of Mormon have cross-references and study aids that make the stick of Judah (the Bible) and the stick of Joseph (the Book of Mormon) one in our hands (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/37.15-17?lang=eng#p15">Ezekiel 37:15–17</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.34-41?lang=eng#p34">1 Nephi 13:34–41</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.12?lang=eng#p12">2 Nephi 3:12</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.8?lang=eng#p8">29:8</a>). Give priority to Book of Mormon passages when you teach, but also show how the Book of Mormon and the Bible teach the same principles.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204308" id="p14">Use the Book of Mormon to clarify and explain Bible passages. For example, the New Testament states that Christ was baptized to “fulfil all righteousness” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/3.14-15?lang=eng#p14">Matthew 3:14–15</a>). The Book of Mormon explains what it means to fulfill all righteousness (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.5-9?lang=eng#p5">2 Nephi 31:5–9</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128204310" id="p15">
      As you use the Book of Mormon and the Bible as companion volumes of scripture, they will overcome contention and correct false doctrine (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.12?lang=eng#p12">2 Nephi 3:12</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204311" id="p16">The Bible teaches the following about the law of witnesses: “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/13.1?lang=eng#p1">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). In harmony with this law, both the Book of Mormon and the Bible testify of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p data-aid="128204384" id="p36">As we read the Book of Mormon with the guidance of the Spirit, it helps us answer personal questions. It teaches that prayer and revelation are the key to solving particular problems. It helps us have faith that God will answer our prayers.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204385" id="p37">The Book of Mormon also helps us understand that God’s commandments are not a restrictive list of dos and don’ts but guideposts to a happy, abundant life. As we begin to understand that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are the way to the abundant life, we will appreciate that these principles help answer any question and fill any need. For example, we understand that repentance, forgiveness, and the covenant to serve others are essential in improving relationships with our spouses. We see that faith in Christ, accepting and keeping covenants, and following the promptings of the Spirit can help teenagers avoid the powerful temptations that surround them.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204387" id="p38">The gospel can resolve almost any question or need.

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128204395" id="p39">Regarding the Book of Mormon, the Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng">introduction to the Book of Mormon</a>). The Book of Mormon is a springboard to testimony and personal revelation. Use the Book of Mormon to help people have spiritual experiences, especially a witness from the Holy Ghost that the book itself is true. By consistently inviting people to live the principles found in the Book of Mormon, you help them develop faith in Jesus Christ and draw nearer to God.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204396" id="p40">President Gordon B. Hinckley declared: “Those who have read [the Book of Mormon] prayerfully, be they rich or poor, learned or unlearned, have grown under its power. … Without reservation I promise you that if you will prayerfully read the Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read it, there will come into your hearts … the Spirit of the Lord. There will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/ensign/1988/06/the-power-of-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng&amp;para=p51#p51">The Power of the Book of Mormon</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> June 1988, 6).</p>

    <p data-aid="128204400" id="p43">“… All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. …</p>

    <p data-aid="128204402" id="p44">“… The only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation.</p>

    </p>
    <p data-aid="128204404" id="p46">For example, sincere people might object to what you have taught about the Word of Wisdom. Help them see that their real question is whether Joseph Smith was speaking as God’s prophet when this commandment was renewed in this dispensation. You might say: “Having the faith to accept this teaching will require the assurance that this commandment came to us through revelation from God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The way to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon.”</p>
    <p data-aid="128204405" id="p47">People must resolve for themselves their concerns and objections. You can help as you focus them on what will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ—reading and praying about the Book of Mormon. When they strengthen their testimony of the Restoration, they will have the strength to overcome their objections and concerns.</p>
    <p data-aid="128204406" id="p48">As you answer concerns, remember that our understanding comes from modern prophets—Joseph Smith and his successors—who receive direct revelation from God. Therefore, the first question someone should answer is whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, and he or she can answer this question by reading and praying about the Book of Mormon.</p>

          <p data-aid="128204452" id="p79">“When we invited the Sniders to be baptized and confirmed, Sister Snider was ready, but Brother Snider said, ‘Don’t get your hopes up, Elders. I don’t know if I can ever do this!’ Although Brother Snider accepted what we taught and was always warm and friendly, he was deeply concerned about how his family would react to his joining another church.</p>
          <p data-aid="128204453" id="p80">
            “After several weeks of watching Brother Snider struggle, my companion and I felt impressed to again read

            with the Sniders. I will never forget what happened that night. As we opened the Book of Mormon, my companion explained, ‘This chapter, as you might recall, recounts the Savior’s visit to the people in the Book of Mormon. Here we read about the Savior’s love for these people and what He taught them.’ We each took turns reading a verse or two. After reading through verse 5, my companion interrupted and said, ‘I have always been impressed with the description given here of the voice they heard. The voice was not harsh, it was not loud, and although it was a small voice, it had a powerful piercing effect on them. This voice was not only heard with their ears, but it spoke to their hearts.’ I watched the Sniders as they listened intently to my companion.
          </p>
          <p data-aid="128204454" id="p81">“After some discussion about prayer and listening to the Spirit, it was Brother Snider’s turn to read: ‘And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them: Behold my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.’ Brother Snider paused, looking intently at his Book of Mormon. Then he looked up at me and said, ‘Heavenly Father was really proud of His Son, wasn’t He?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. Brother Snider looked back at his book again and stared at the open pages as if deep in thought. Finally he said, ‘I would want Heavenly Father to be proud of me too. I wonder how He would introduce me. I guess, if I … well, if I want Him to be proud of me then I had better do what He wants me to do.’ ‘Yes, I think that would be important,’ I replied. ‘Well,’ Brother Snider continued. ‘I think I’ve been worrying too much about what everybody else thinks and not enough about what God thinks.’ After a brief pause Brother Snider nodded and with a determined look said, ‘I think I had better be baptized.’ His response was so unexpected that my companion and I looked at him with blank stares. Finally, my companion said, ‘Yes, that would be the right thing to do. In fact, later on in this chapter the Savior teaches …’ As my companion talked I felt a burning in my heart and gratitude for the power of the Book of Mormon.”</p>

  <p data-aid="128199159" id="p1">At the beginning of His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ walked along the shore of the sea of Galilee and called out to two fishermen, Peter and Andrew. “Follow me,” He said, “and I will make you fishers of men” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4.19?lang=eng#p19">Matthew 4:19</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/mark/1.17?lang=eng#p17">Mark 1:17</a>). The Lord has also called you to His work, and He invites you to follow Him. The invitation to follow Christ is an invitation to follow His example and to become like Him, which can only happen through the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p19">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</p>
  <p data-aid="128199161" id="p2">Some chapters in <cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> focus on what you need to do as a missionary—how to study, how to teach, how to manage time wisely. Just as vital as what you do, however, is who you are and who you are becoming. This is part of what it means to endure to the end through increasing your faith in Christ, continuing regularly to repent of your sins by relying upon Christ, renewing your covenants with the Father and the Son through partaking of the sacrament regularly, and following the promptings of the Holy Ghost in all things.</p>
  <p data-aid="128199162" id="p3">
    The restored gospel enables you to become like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The Savior has shown the way. He has set the perfect example, and He commands us to become as He is (see
    <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27?lang=eng#p27">3 Nephi 27:27</a>). Learn of Him and seek to incorporate His attributes into your life. Through the power of His Atonement, you can achieve this goal and lead others to achieve it also.
  </p>
  <p data-aid="128199164" id="p4"><span class="page-break" data-page="122"></span>The scriptures describe Christlike attributes that are essential for you to eventually develop as a missionary and throughout your life. Study the scripture passages in this chapter and look for other examples of Christlike attributes as you study other passages.</p>
  <p data-aid="128199166" id="p5">Christlike attributes are gifts from God. They come as you use your agency righteously. Ask your Heavenly Father to bless you with these attributes; you cannot develop them without His help. With a desire to please God, recognize your weaknesses and be willing and anxious to improve.</p>

    <p data-aid="128199192" id="p10">When you have faith in Christ, you believe in Him as the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. You accept Him as your Savior and Redeemer and follow His teachings. You believe that your sins can be forgiven through His Atonement. Faith in Him means that you trust Him and are confident that He loves you.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199194" id="p11">
      Faith leads to action, including repentance, obedience, and dedicated service. When you have faith in Jesus Christ, you trust the Lord enough to follow His commandments—even when you do not completely understand the reasons for them. You accomplish what the Lord wants you to accomplish. You help bring about good in your own life and the lives of
      <span class="page-break" data-page="123"></span>others. You are able to do miracles according to the Lord’s will. Your faith will be manifest through diligence and work.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128199196" id="p12">
      Faith is a principle of power. God works by power, but His power is usually exercised in response to faith (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.7?lang=eng#p7">Moroni 10:7</a>). He works according to the faith of His children. Doubt and fear are opposed to faith.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128199198" id="p13">Your faith will increase through diligent study, prayer, dedicated service, and obedience to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and the commandments.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199199" id="p14">Your faith in Jesus Christ grows as you become better acquainted with Him and His teachings. As you explore the scriptures and search them, you learn of His ways, His love for all people, and His commandments.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199201" id="p15">Faith includes confidence in the mission and power of the Holy Ghost. Through faith you receive answers to your prayers and personal inspiration to guide you in the Lord’s work.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200097" id="p16">Hope is an abiding trust that the Lord will fulfill His promises to you. It is manifest in confidence, optimism, enthusiasm, and patient perseverance. It is believing and expecting that something will occur. When you have hope, you work through trials and difficulties with the confidence and assurance that all things will work together for your good. Hope helps you conquer discouragement. The scriptures often describe hope in Jesus Christ as the assurance that you will inherit eternal life in the celestial kingdom.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200118" id="p21">A man once asked Jesus, “Which is the great commandment in the law?” Jesus replied: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22.36-39?lang=eng#p36">Matthew 22:36–39</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128200119" id="p22">Charity is “the pure love of Christ” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47?lang=eng#p47">Moroni 7:47</a>). It includes God’s eternal love for all His children. We are to seek to develop that kind of love. When you are filled with charity, you obey God’s commandments and do all you can to serve others and help them receive the restored gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200120" id="p23">Charity is a gift from God. The prophet Mormon said that we should “pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that [we] may be filled with this love” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48?lang=eng#p48">Moroni 7:48</a>). As you follow this counsel and strive to do righteous works, your love for all people will increase, especially those among whom you labor. You will come to feel a sincere concern for the eternal welfare and happiness of other people. You will see them as children of God with the potential of becoming like our Heavenly Father, and you will labor in their behalf. You will avoid negative feelings such as anger, envy, lust, or covetousness. You will avoid judging others, criticizing them, or saying negative things about them. You will try to understand them and their points of view. You will be patient with them and try to help them when they are struggling or discouraged. Charity, like faith, leads to action. You will develop charity as you look for opportunities to serve others and give of yourself.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200141" id="p24">Virtue originates in your innermost thoughts and desires. It is a pattern of thought and behavior based on high moral standards. Since the Holy Ghost does not dwell in unclean tabernacles, virtue is prerequisite to receiving the Spirit’s guidance. What you choose to think and do when you are alone and you believe no one is watching is a strong measure of your virtue.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200142" id="p25">Virtuous people are clean and pure spiritually. They focus on righteous, uplifting thoughts and put unworthy thoughts that lead to inappropriate actions out of their minds. They obey God’s commandments and follow the counsel of Church leaders. They pray for the strength to resist temptation and do what is right. They quickly repent of any sins or wrongdoings. They live worthy of a temple recommend.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200143" id="p26">Your mind is like a stage in a theater; in the theater of your mind, however, only one actor can be on stage at a time. If the stage is left bare, thoughts of darkness and sin often enter the stage to tempt. But these thoughts have no power if the stage of your mind is occupied by wholesome thoughts, such as a memorized hymn or verse of scripture that you can call upon in a moment of temptation. By controlling the stage of your mind, you can successfully resist persistent urges to yield to temptation and indulge in sin. You can become pure and virtuous.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200155" id="p27">The Lord commanded, “Seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118?lang=eng#p118">Doctrine and Covenants 88:118</a>).

Seek knowledge, especially spiritual knowledge. Study the scriptures every day, and also study the words of the living prophets. Through study and prayer, seek help for your specific questions, challenges, and opportunities. Give special attention to scripture passages you can use as you teach and as you answer questions about the restored gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200156" id="p28">Think about how you can apply gospel principles in your life. As you study diligently, prayerfully, and with pure intent, the Holy Ghost will enlighten your mind, teach you, and help you understand the meaning of the scriptures and the teachings of living prophets. You can also gain knowledge by watching and listening to others, especially Church leaders. Like Nephi, you can say: “My soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them. … Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.15-16?lang=eng#p15">2 Nephi 4:15–16</a>).</p>

    <p data-aid="128200170" id="p29">Patience is the capacity to endure delay, trouble, opposition, or suffering without becoming angry, frustrated, or anxious. It is the ability to do God’s will and accept His timing. When you are patient, you hold up under pressure and are able to face adversity calmly and hopefully. Patience is related to hope and faith—you must wait for the Lord’s promised blessings to be fulfilled.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200171" id="p30">You need patience in your everyday experiences and relationships, especially with your companion. You must be patient with all people, yourself included, as you work to overcome faults and weaknesses.</p>
    <aside class="quote" id="aside2">
      <p data-aid="128200172" id="aside2_p1">“Life is full of difficulties, some minor and others of a more serious nature. There seems to be an unending supply of challenges for one and all. Our problem is that we often expect instantaneous solutions to such challenges, forgetting that frequently the heavenly virtue of patience is required.”</p>

      Humility is willingness to submit to the will of the Lord and to give the Lord the honor for what is accomplished. It includes gratitude for His blessings and acknowledgment of your constant need for His divine help. Humility is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of spiritual strength. When you humbly trust Him and acknowledge His power and mercy, you can have the assurance that His commandments are for your good. You are confident that you can do whatever the Lord requires
      <span class="page-break" data-page="127"></span>of you if you rely on Him. You are also willing to trust His chosen servants and follow their counsel. Humility will help you as you strive to be obedient, to work hard, and to serve selflessly.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128200217" id="p32">The opposite of humility is pride, which is condemned in the scriptures. To be prideful means to put greater trust in oneself than in God or in His servants. It also means to put the things of the world above the things of God. Prideful people take honor to themselves rather than giving God the glory. Pride is competitive; those who are prideful seek to have more and presume they are better than other people. Pride usually results in feelings of anger and hatred, and it is a great stumbling block.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200301" id="p33">Diligence is steady, consistent, earnest, and energetic effort in doing the Lord’s work. The Lord expects you to work diligently—persistently and with great effort and care. A diligent missionary works effectively and efficiently. Diligence in missionary work is an expression of your love for the Lord and His work. When you are diligent, you find joy and satisfaction in your work.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200305" id="p34">
      Do many good things of your own free will (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27?lang=eng#p27">Doctrine and Covenants 58:27</a>). Don’t wait for your leaders to tell you what to do. Continue until you have done all you can, even when you are tired. Focus on the most important things and avoid wasting time. Pray for guidance and strength. Plan regularly and effectively. Avoid anything that distracts your thoughts or actions.
    </p>
    <aside class="quote" id="aside3">
      <p data-aid="128200309" id="aside3_p1">“I have often said one of the greatest secrets of missionary work is work! If a missionary works, he will get the Spirit; if he gets the Spirit, he will teach by the Spirit; and if he teaches by the Spirit, he will touch the hearts of the people and he will be happy. There will be no homesickness, no worrying about families, for all time and talents and interests are centered on the work of the ministry. Work, work, work—there is no satisfactory substitute, especially in missionary work.”</p>

    <p data-aid="128199139" id="p1">The Lord declared, “Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.11?lang=eng#p11">Doctrine and Covenants 90:11</a>). Strengthen your personal testimony to bring converting power to your words. First study the doctrine and the lessons in your native language. That understanding will strengthen your testimony and your capacity to teach and testify convincingly. You can then learn to express the message of the Restoration in your mission language under the guidance of the Spirit.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199140" id="p2">Listed below are ways you can strengthen your faith that the Lord will help you teach and testify in your mission language:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199141" id="p3">Recognize that you have been called of God by a prophet.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199150" id="p8">Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort and the gifts of the Spirit. Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first. Learning a language takes time. Be patient with yourself. Listen carefully, speak the language often, learn new vocabulary, and practice grammar and pronunciation every day. Seek the help of your companion, members, those you teach, and other missionaries.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199153" id="p9">Do not stop improving your language skills once people begin to understand you. As your ability to speak the language grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you say it. You will be less worried about how to communicate the feelings that are in your heart. You will be better able to respond to the needs of those you teach and the promptings of the Spirit.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199155" id="p10">Strive to master the language throughout your mission and after you return. The Lord has invested much in you, and He may have uses for your language abilities later in your life. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained: “We would … hope that every missionary learning a new … language would master it in every way possible. … And as you do so, your [teaching] and testifying skills will improve. You will be better received by and more spiritually impressive to [the people you teach]. … Don’t be satisfied with what we call a missionary vocabulary only. Stretch yourself in the language, and you will gain greater access to the hearts of the people” (missionary satellite broadcast, Aug. 1998).</p>
    <p data-aid="128199158" id="p11">
      You are not alone in learning your mission language. Whenever the Lord gives a commandment, He provides a way to accomplish it (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7?lang=eng#p7">1 Nephi 3:7</a>). Seek His help. Be dedicated in your study. In time you will acquire the language skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a missionary.

    <p data-aid="128199163" id="p12">If you do not speak English, you should study it as a missionary. This will bless you during your mission and throughout your life. Learning English will enable you to help build the Lord’s kingdom in additional ways and will be a blessing for you and your family. Many of the suggestions found in this chapter will help you. Focus particularly on the following:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199165" id="p13">Set a goal to speak English with your companion. If your companion already knows English and is trying to learn your language, you might choose to speak English in the apartment and the mission language when you go out.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199168" id="p14">With your companion, read from the Book of Mormon in English. You might also choose to alternate: You read a verse in English, and then your companion reads a verse in the mission language. Correct each other’s pronunciation and intonation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199170" id="p15">Ask your mission president for suggestions on a simple English grammar text if you do not already have one.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199175" id="p16">This section describes principles to help you study and learn the language more effectively.</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199178" id="p17"><strong>Take responsibility.</strong> Regularly create or adjust your language learning goals and study plan. Strive to use the language at every opportunity.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199180" id="p18"><span class="page-break" data-page="135"></span><strong>Make your study meaningful.</strong> Ask yourself: Why am I studying this? How will it help me communicate better? Relate what you study to real-life situations and daily activities. Study parts of the language that will help you say what you want to say. For example, if there is a scripture story you would like to include in your teaching, learn the vocabulary and grammar necessary to relate it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199183" id="p19"><strong>Seek to communicate.</strong> Seek to find an appropriate balance between studying grammar and the structure of the language and learning through your daily activities. There is no substitute for talking with native speakers of the language.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199185" id="p20"><strong>Learn new concepts thoroughly.</strong> You will be able to recall and effectively use language principles if you review regularly what you have studied and if you practice it again in new situations.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199190" id="p21">A language study plan helps both new and experienced missionaries focus on what they can do each day to improve their ability to speak the mission language. Your plan will include what you will do during your language study time and what you will do throughout the day.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199193" id="p22">As needed, use some of your language study time to create or adjust your study plan. Then during your language study time, learn the language needed for the day’s activities. The following guidelines will help you in creating your own language learning plan:</p>
    <ol class="decimal" start="1">
      <li data-marker="1.">
        <p data-aid="128199195" id="p23"><strong>Set goals.</strong> Weekly and daily goals will help you learn your mission language. Focus your goals on improving your ability to communicate and teach during scheduled activities, such as teaching appointments, finding opportunities, and ward council meetings. Review your progress in achieving your language goals. Ask yourself what you can do to communicate with greater clarity and power during your scheduled activities.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199311" id="p66">Help your companions experience success and gain confidence in learning the language as rapidly as possible. Sincerely and frequently compliment your companions and other missionaries on their progress. Be sensitive not to say or do anything that might weaken their confidence, but don’t protect them so much that they do not learn. Do not withhold help when it is needed. Give them many opportunities to teach and testify successfully. Consider the following ideas for learning with your companions:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199313" id="p67">Teach each other the grammar and vocabulary you have learned.</p>

      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199316" id="p68"><span class="page-break" data-page="138"></span>Practice teaching in the mission language. At first, new missionaries might teach very simply, share a simple testimony, and recite memorized scriptures. As their confidence and ability increase, they will be able to participate more fully in teaching others.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199318" id="p69">Practice using the language to communicate in common missionary situations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199321" id="p70">Give each other simple and practical feedback with kindness. It is also important that you receive feedback without taking offense.</p>

    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199323" id="p71">Note how a more experienced missionary helped his companion in the following true account.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199326" id="p72">I had just arrived in my second area when my companion told me it was my turn to give the spiritual thought at a dinner appointment. I was more than just a little scared. My first companion had always been happy to do the teaching, and I was used to giving my small portion of the lesson and then listening as he would then expound and answer any questions.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199328" id="p73">I tried to convince my companion that he should give the spiritual thought, but he encouraged me to take the assignment. I practiced with his help.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199331" id="p74">

I struggled but managed to explain why I felt my chosen passages were significant, and I was relieved when I was done. When a question was asked, I looked to my companion to answer, but he didn’t open his mouth. That was when I amazed myself by coming up with an answer in understandable French. I was even more amazed that the member didn’t seem to sense that I was insecure about my communication skills. I gained confidence and realized that my French was better than I gave myself credit for.
      </p>
      <p data-aid="128199333" id="p75">The weeks passed, and my companion continued to let me teach—even when I didn’t think I could do it, even when he probably wondered if I could do it. And because he encouraged me to speak, listen, and teach, my language skills began to progress more quickly, and I felt that I had become a tool of our Father in Heaven instead of being simply another elder’s quiet companion.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199346" id="p76">Culture and language are closely related. Understanding the culture will help explain why language is used the way it is. Strive to understand the culture of the people so that you can communicate the unique aspects of the message of the Restoration in a way that will be clear to them.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199349" id="p77">
      One of the greatest things you can do to gain people’s trust and love is to embrace their culture in appropriate ways. Many great missionaries have done so (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/9.20-23?lang=eng#p20">1 Corinthians 9:20–23</a>). Seek to have the people feel comfortable with you and your language.

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199362" id="p78">Gifts of the Spirit are real. The gift of tongues and the gift of the interpretation of tongues can help you as much or more than any other single thing to speak and understand the language of the people in your mission.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171537" id="p108">The gift of tongues and the interpretation of tongues has many manifestations, including speaking and understanding an unknown language as an endowment of the Spirit. It also includes speaking and understanding a known language with or without the aid of study.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171538" id="p109">Today, the gift of tongues and the interpretation of tongues is most often manifested in Spirit-enhanced learning and studying to speak and understand a mission language. Additionally, the Holy Ghost can manifest the truth of your testimony even though a language barrier may exist between you and those you teach. Likewise, the Holy Ghost can bring words and phrases to your remembrance and help you understand what people are saying from their hearts as you teach people in a mission language.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171539" id="p110">For the most part, you will not obtain these gifts without effort; you need to actively seek them. Part of seeking the gift of tongues is to labor and struggle and to do all you can to learn the language. Be patient as you prayerfully study and practice the language. Trust that the Spirit will help you as you live the way you should and do your very best. Have faith that you can have the gift of tongues in its true and most comprehensive sense.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199364" id="p79">When you feel you are struggling to express yourself as clearly as you would like, remember that the Spirit is able to speak to the hearts of all of God’s children. President Thomas S. Monson taught: “There is one language … that is common to each missionary—the language of the Spirit. It is not learned from textbooks written by men of letters, nor is it acquired through reading and memorization. The language of the Spirit comes to him who seeks with all his heart to know God and keep His divine commandments. Proficiency in this language permits one to breach barriers, overcome obstacles, and touch the human heart” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/ensign/1997/06/the-spirit-giveth-life?lang=eng&amp;para=p6#p6">The Spirit Giveth Life</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> June 1997, 2).</p>

Where traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be cherished” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1998/04/removing-barriers-to-happiness?lang=eng&amp;para=p27#p27">Removing Barriers to Happiness</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1998, 87).

    <p data-aid="128201043" id="p6">These indicators identify events and conditions that show a person’s progress toward enduring conversion. A brief description of each key indicator is given below.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201046" id="p7"><strong>People baptized and confirmed:</strong> Each convert who has received the ordinances of baptism and confirmation.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201048" id="p8"><strong>People with a baptismal date:</strong> Each person who has agreed to be baptized and confirmed on specific dates.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201051" id="p9"><strong>People who attended sacrament meeting:</strong> Each person (not baptized) you are teaching who has attended sacrament meeting.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201065" id="p15"><strong>New people being taught:</strong> The total number of people (not baptized) who have received a lesson and accepted a specific return appointment. A lesson typically includes a prayer (when appropriate), the teaching of at least one gospel principle or topic, and extending appropriate invitations.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201070" id="p17">As you set goals and make plans, evaluate what you do in terms of how your efforts will add to the numbers of people represented in each of these key indicators. Your goal should be to have increasing numbers for every key indicator.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201073" id="p18">You will do many things that are not described in the key indicators, such as street contacting or personal and companion study. These important activities contribute to one or more of the key indicators. For example, when you teach those you find through your own efforts, you add new people to your teaching pool. Also, the quality of your personal and companion study will improve your ability to teach by the Spirit, blessing the people you are teaching. The power of your finding and teaching will influence every key indicator. Evaluate all you do based on whether it adds to the numbers of people in these categories. If you and your companion cannot see how a missionary activity might help increase the numbers of people in one or more key indicators, you need to question whether the activity is worth your time.</p>

        In your study journal, list every missionary activity you have done in the past three days. For each activity, determine if it influenced one of the key indicators. If it did, write
        <i>yes</i> beside it. If it did not, write <i>no.</i> For each activity with a <i>yes,</i> describe how it had an impact. For each activity with a <i>no,</i> decide why you did it and whether you will continue to do the activity in the future. Discuss your list with your companion, and explain why you marked some activities <i>yes</i> and some activities <i>no.</i> Discuss which activities you may need to stop doing.

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128202190" id="p73">Goals reflect the desires of our hearts and our vision of what we can accomplish. Through goals and plans, our hopes are transformed into action. Goal setting and planning are acts of faith. Prayerfully set goals that are in harmony with the Savior’s command to “teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28.19?lang=eng#p19">Matthew 28:19</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128202191" id="p74">Set goals for each key indicator. You may also set goals for your personal development. Do everything within your power to achieve your goals while respecting the agency of others. The ultimate measure of success is not in achieving goals alone but in the service you render and the progress of others. Goals are a means of helping you bring about much good among Heavenly Father’s children. They are not to be used to receive recognition.</p>
    <aside class="quote" id="aside1">
      <p data-aid="128202192" id="aside1_p1">“I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don’t set goals in our life and learn how to master the techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential. When one learns to master the principles of setting a goal, he will then be able to make a great difference in the results he attains in this life.”</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128202213" id="p84">Once you have set goals, decide how you will achieve them. You and your companion should hold a weekly planning session on a day and at a time that is less productive for sharing the gospel. Your mission president will set the day and time of the weekly planning session. This weekly planning should not take more than two to three hours to complete.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202214" id="p85">Your discussion should focus on the needs of people and how to help them progress. During this weekly planning session, review past goals and set new goals for the coming week and month. Consider every aspect of your missionary work.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202215" id="p86">Sunday evening is the recommended time for completing the Weekly and Monthly Key Indicator Report. If you do not report key indicators automatically or through the Missionary Portal, then a Sunday-evening report provides the most accurate and timely status of the mission because most baptisms and confirmations take place on Saturday or Sunday.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202216" id="p87">Because the day you hold your weekly planning session is likely to be different from your reporting day, approach your weekly planning with 10 days in mind. For example, if your weekly planning session is on Thursday, you will review the progress on your goals so far that week, and you will plan what you need to do to achieve these goals through Sunday. Then, set goals and make plans for the next week from Monday to Sunday. On Sunday evening you will total and report the results from the past week, and you will have your plan ready for the coming week. Below is a description of how the planning guidelines apply to a weekly planning session. As you use these guidelines, notice that you will follow a pattern of first setting goals and then making plans to achieve them. The plans you make should identify the specific steps you need to take to reach your goals.</p>

It is a principle that influences how you begin, how you think and feel about the responsibility the Lord has given you, how you approach your work, and how well you endure. The attitude you have toward your mission experience is a reflection of your love toward your Heavenly Father and His Son and your respect for the priesthood.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202247" id="p113">As you pray personally and in your companionship, seek inspiration on what you should do each day. As you follow your plans, pray and ask the Lord for guidance. Have a prayer in your heart throughout the day that the Spirit will help you know where to go, what to do, and what to say. Ask yourself, “What more can I do?” In your prayer at the end of the day, give an accounting of your work.</p>
    <p data-aid="128202248" id="p114">You will give an accounting each week to your mission leaders during your weekly report, during district council, and in other settings throughout the week. If you are a mission leader, you will receive this information from other missionaries. Show an interest in their lives and in the lives of those they teach rather than simply in numbers. Do not use these tools or the information you receive as ways to control or manipulate. The information you receive through these tools will provide you with opportunities to praise missionaries for their dedication and to see opportunities for future training.</p>

In your Missionary Daily Planner, locate the page titled “Events That Lead to Baptism, Confirmation, and Activity in the Church.” Select one event, and make a list of everything you need to do in order for this event to happen. Discuss how you might plan these tasks so that the event can happen at the earliest possible time.</p>

          <p data-aid="128202283" id="p127">Discuss the following analogy with your companion. Evaluate how long your “line” is in the water each day.</p>
          <p data-aid="128202284" id="p128">“None of us should be like the fisherman who thinks he has been fishing all day when in reality he has spent most of his time getting to and from the water, eating lunch, and fussing with his equipment. Fishing success is related to how long you have your line in the water, not to how long you are away from the apartment. Some fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for ten hours. Other fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for only two hours. This last type may wonder why they do not have the same success as others.</p>
          <p data-aid="128202285" id="p129">“The same principle applies to missionaries, whom the Master called ‘fishers of men.’ A missionary’s line should drop into the fishing water the moment he or she leaves the apartment” (Dallin H. Oaks, seminar for new mission presidents, June 20, 2000).</p>

      <h2 data-aid="128200267" id="title2">Developing the Faith to Find</h2>
    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200270" id="p1">The doctrine and principles in this chapter will strengthen your faith that the Lord is preparing people to receive you and the restored gospel. He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you. Finding is different in different parts of the world. Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances. Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200273" id="p2"><strong>The Family of God.</strong> All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/acts/17.26-29?lang=eng#p26">Acts 17:26–29</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/heb/12.9?lang=eng#p9">Hebrews 12:9</a>). We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater blessings as members of His family in the life to come. We are all brothers and sisters in the family of God. This knowledge gives us a sense of identity and belonging. It gives us reason to hope for eternal life in God’s presence. We understand these basic truths because of the Restoration. Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is your responsibility and blessing. Like Alma seeking to help the apostate Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious … ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.34-35?lang=eng#p34">Alma 31:34–35</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128200275" id="p3"><span class="page-break" data-page="160"></span><strong>“Find Them That Will Receive You.”</strong> You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.8?lang=eng#p8">Doctrine and Covenants 42:8</a>). Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will be willing to act on your message. Many of these people have been “kept from the truth [only] because they know not where to find it” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.12?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 123:12</a>).</p>
    <p data-aid="128200277" id="p4">Usually you do not know who these people are. They may not immediately recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They may not understand that greater peace, direction, and purpose in life will come through the restored gospel than from anything else. They often do not realize that they are looking for the restored gospel until they have found it. For example, one convert said, “When I heard the gospel, it filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t know was there.” Another said, “I have finished the search I didn’t know I was on.”</p>
    <p data-aid="128200280" id="p5">Wherever you are assigned to serve, remember that the Lord has “suffered you to come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in [Him] for the salvation of souls.” Work effectively to “lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that [the Lord] shall put in your hearts.” If you do, you will receive the promise that “you shall not be confounded before men,” and “it shall be given you … in the very moment, what ye shall say” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.4-6?lang=eng#p4">Doctrine and Covenants 100:4–6</a>). Finding by the Spirit is as important as teaching by the Spirit. As in teaching, your efforts in finding will be effective if you are guided by the Spirit. Have faith that you will know what to teach and what to do to find those who will receive you.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200314" id="p6">While the Prophet Joseph Smith was traveling with a group of missionaries on the Missouri River, the Lord revealed, “It is not needful for … mine elders to be moving swiftly … whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61.3?lang=eng#p3">Doctrine and Covenants 61:3</a>). As you move swiftly to planned activities, pray for the ability to see unplanned opportunities to serve and teach those who may be “perishing in unbelief.” Pray for the spiritual sensitivity to recognize <span class="page-break" data-page="161"></span>opportunities. You will find that God will place in your path His children who are being prepared to receive the restored gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200317" id="p7">Nothing happens in missionary work until you find someone to teach. Talk with as many people as you can each day. It is natural to be somewhat apprehensive about talking to people, but you can pray for the faith and strength to be more bold in opening your mouth to proclaim the restored gospel. Try applying the following ideas as you seek to talk with everyone you meet:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200330" id="p12">Trust the Spirit to put into your heart and mind what to teach.</p>

      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200327" id="p11">Be warm, authentic, friendly, and cheerful. Offer to help.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200319" id="p8">Talk to people about their families. Help them see how the restored gospel can be a blessing to their families.</p>

      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200322" id="p9">Offer to help them find the names of grandparents, great-grandparents, or other ancestors. Enlist the help of ward temple and family history consultants.</p>

    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128200341" id="p16">As you read the following true account, look for how the man was prepared to receive the missionaries and how the missionaries used an unplanned opportunity to teach him the gospel.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128200344" id="p17">As a child, I was never taught to read the Bible. I went to church on Sundays, but I contributed nothing and felt nothing in return. I was disillusioned. … I searched for … God—wanting to know if He even existed. I thirsted to know Him and His words. But I could not seem to find what I sought.</p>
      <p data-aid="128200347" id="p18">There were moments when I felt close to quenching my thirst. When I held my first child, a daughter, in my arms for the first time, I had a feeling that God really did exist. Many years later, when her sister was born, I experienced the same feeling. … Most of the time, however, an inexplicable tiredness weighed upon my soul. I was spiritually thirsty and could find no place to drink.</p>
      <p data-aid="128200349" id="p19">In April 1994 I was living in the city of Monterrey, Mexico, earning a living as a taxi driver. One day it rained for hours, sending water cascading down the mountainsides. After driving around in the rain for hours, I found myself in a little town about eight kilometers (five miles) from Monterrey. It was about … nearly time to go home. Suddenly I saw two young men on foot. They were wearing dark trousers and white shirts, and they looked drenched from head to foot.</p>
      <p data-aid="128200352" id="p20">When I approached them, I opened the door of the taxi and called, “Get in! I’m going to Monterrey.”</p>
      <p data-aid="128200355" id="p21">The taller one … replied, “We don’t have any money.”</p>
      <p data-aid="128200358" id="p22">“No charge,” I replied.</p>
      <p data-aid="128200360" id="p23">They quickly got into the taxi.</p>
      <p data-aid="128200363" id="p24">As I drove, we talked. They asked if they could share a message about Jesus Christ with me. I agreed and gave them my address.</p>
      <p data-aid="128200366" id="p25">When I got home, I woke my wife and told her about the two young men. “What a coincidence,” I said. “One is Mexican and the other is American, and they are both named Elder.”</p>
      <p data-aid="128200369" id="p26">“Elder means missionary,” my wife answered, knowing just a little about the Church.</p>
      <p data-aid="128200371" id="p27">From deep within me, I felt something stir. These young men had left a feeling of exquisite wonder in my heart. I felt that I was close to finding the water that would quench my thirst, that it was within reach.</p>
      <p data-aid="128200374" id="p28">The missionaries came to our home on 5 June, and I was happy to listen to them. Two weeks later, on 19 June, I was baptized. My wife was baptized four months later, in October [, as was my daughter].</p>
      <p data-aid="128200377" id="p29"><span class="page-break" data-page="162"></span>In December 1995 we were sealed as a family in the Mexico City Mexico Temple for this life and for eternity. Now we are a family enjoying harmony, peace, and happiness. We know who we worship. We know where we came from and where we are going. We love God’s word, especially the Book of Mormon, and we love His Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Through these gifts we have found that well of living water the Savior spoke of to the woman of Samaria: “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/4.14?lang=eng#p14">John 4:14</a>).

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199540" id="p30">Finding and teaching are related, connected activities. When you meet people, be prepared to teach brief summaries of restored truth so that the Holy Ghost can bear witness that you are the servants of the Lord. In many situations, you will need to be able to share a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message of the Restoration in just two or three sentences:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199541" id="p31">After centuries of being lost, original truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a loving God through a living prophet. We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read, ponder in your heart, and pray about to learn its truth for yourself. Will you allow us to …</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p data-aid="128199542" id="p32">If a little more time is available, you might say more:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199543" id="p33">Our message is simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrine and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199544" id="p34">Our invitation to you is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the true doctrine and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth in your mind and heart.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p data-aid="128199545" id="p35"><span class="page-break" data-page="163"></span>Develop the habit of beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199546" id="p36">
      Whatever your initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all teaching situations—such as finding, teaching people, and working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.12?lang=eng#p12">1 Nephi 8:12</a>). They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach.

    <p data-aid="128199554" id="p37">The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ blesses families and individuals. By living the principles of the restored gospel, families and individuals are strengthened and can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199555" id="p38">Addressing the importance of the family with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199556" id="p39">There is nothing more important to us than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us some unique identity.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199557" id="p40">Having a strong, happy family is the highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the evils that are all around us.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p data-aid="128199558" id="p41"><span class="page-break" data-page="164"></span>You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199559" id="p42">The feelings of love and concern that we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrine and ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. May we teach you more about …</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p data-aid="128199560" id="p43">The same thing can be done with other topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our unique message to the world.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199562" id="p44">Work with members of the Church to find people to teach. The ideal situation is when members invite others to be taught and are present for the teaching. When members do this, more people are baptized and remain active in the Church. Association with members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads them to learn more about the restored gospel. This often means that they are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including active and returning members, recent converts, and part-member families.</p>
    <aside class="quote" id="aside1">
      <p data-aid="128199563" id="aside1_p1">“After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.”</p>

    <p data-aid="128199566" id="p45">President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting. Everyone who is familiar with this work knows there is a better way. That way is through the members of the Church. Whenever there is a member who introduces [someone], there is an immediate support system. The member bears testimony of the truth of the work. He is anxious for the happiness of his … friend. He becomes excited as that friend makes progress in learning the gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199567" id="p46">“The full-time missionaries may do the actual teaching, but the member, wherever possible, will back up that teaching with the offering of his home to carry on this missionary service. He will bear sincere testimony of the divinity of the work. He will be there to answer questions when the missionaries are not around. He will be a friend to the convert who is making a big and often difficult change. … The process of bringing new people into the Church is not the responsibility alone of the missionaries. They succeed best when members become the source from which new [people] are found” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p21-22,25#p21">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1999, 105–6).</p>
    <p data-aid="128199568" id="p47">The starting point in building strong relationships with members is the bishop. Offer to help and serve in any righteous way that he asks. Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing or a burden to the bishop?” Develop a “How can I help?” attitude. If you will look for opportunities to love, serve, and teach, the bishop and ward members will be more likely to trust you with their family members and friends.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199569" id="p48"><span class="page-break" data-page="165"></span>Consider the following excerpt from a letter written by a missionary to his mission president:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199570" id="p49">Dear President,</p>
      <p data-aid="128199571" id="p50">The assistants called today telling me I’m being transferred. I felt that I should write and thank you for sending me to this area. It seems like it was just yesterday that you were telling me about the challenges that lay ahead.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199572" id="p51">Our first Sunday confirmed what you told me. We received a lukewarm welcome to the ward. The only ray of light that first Sunday was Scott, the new ward mission leader. He had been transferred to the Air Force base a month earlier and had been serving as ward mission leader for two weeks. Scott invited us to his home for dinner our first Sunday to discuss what could be done to get the work moving. After dinner, we knelt in prayer and asked Heavenly Father for His direction. As we prayed, we felt a sense of peace and determination. We determined that the best way to move the work forward was to gain the trust of the members. We decided to follow Ammon’s example and serve them.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199573" id="p52">We started with the bishop. Because of the lack of baptisms in the area and the lack of effort from the previous missionaries, he was understandably less than excited at our request to meet with him. He eventually invited us over to his home for dinner. We learned that the bishop was preparing to remove the carpet from his living room and restore the hardwood floor found underneath. We volunteered our help and he accepted. At the conclusion of the project, the bishop asked us to speak in a sacrament meeting. We took this as evidence that he was beginning to trust us.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199574" id="p53">We followed this same pattern of service as we met with other members. We found opportunities to help them in a variety of simple ways. When we were not with the members, we were knocking on doors and talking to as many people as we could about the restored gospel. We were blessed with people to teach, and the members saw us bringing people to church whom we were finding on our own. The attitude of the whole ward began to change. There was an increasing excitement about missionary work. Once the members trusted us, the work hastened. Many baptisms followed.</p>

      Many members of the Church have fears about doing missionary work. Many are unsure where to begin or what to say. Many fear that they will lose close friends if they try to share the gospel with them. There are many ways to help the members. For example, help build their faith by teaching them the message of the Restoration and other doctrine in the lessons. Help them feel the Spirit and power of our message. Strengthening their understanding of the doctrine of Christ will do more to increase their trust in you and to build their excitement to do missionary work than anything else you can do. Help them understand that offering the restored gospel will flow more naturally out of relationships where they are seeking to love and serve their family members and friends. Teach them the principles from the “Go About Doing Good” section (see
      <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/what-is-my-purpose-as-a-missionary?lang=eng&amp;para=title33#title33">chapter 1</a>). Encourage members to “join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who [know] not God” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/6.6?lang=eng#p6">Alma 6:6</a>). In all you do with members, seek to lift and build their faith to help them do missionary work.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128199576" id="p55">In addition to working with active members, seek to find people to teach through part-member families, prospective elders, returning members, and new members. These members are likely to have many friends of other faiths and be blessed as they share the restored gospel with their family members and friends.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199577" id="p56"><span class="page-break" data-page="166"></span>In every visit with members, do all you can to encourage them to:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199578" id="p57">Pray and follow the Spirit.</p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199583" id="p62">Every referral you receive from a member should be treated as something precious. When a member gives you the name of a friend to call or visit, respond quickly and report the results back to the member. Invite the member to help you teach.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200510" id="p63">Referrals are another important resource in finding those being prepared for the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Referrals may come from members, other missionaries, or Church headquarters. The Church actively reaches out in many ways to God’s children through efforts such as media advertising, visitors’ centers, historic sites, welfare and humanitarian aid, and the internet.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171551" id="p169">When you receive a referral, contact the member or missionaries who sent it to you and ask them how you can help the person. You may invite the member or missionaries (with their mission president’s approval) to participate in teaching the person using available technology.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171552" id="p170">When you meet someone who is interested in learning more but lives outside your assigned area, introduce the person to the gospel and help him or her prepare to meet members and missionaries where he or she lives. After you send a referral, work with the missionaries who received the referral to help them begin teaching. With your mission president’s approval, you may continue to support and fellowship people you refer to help them receive the gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171553" id="p171">You can also help members share the gospel with people they know. As members prepare and invite their friends to meet with missionaries, show members how to send a referral, contact the missionaries, and participate in teaching to help ensure the person they refer has a good experience.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171554" id="p172">Most people who respond to Church media campaigns have agreed to have Church representatives visit and share more about the gospel. You should view these teaching opportunities as a sacred responsibility.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200512" id="p64">In some cases, referrals lead you to others whom God is preparing. If the people you contact are not interested, ask them if they know someone who might be. Talk with other members of the household and their neighbors as well. Ask each person who else might be interested in your message. Perhaps you have been led to this person because someone else in the home or neighborhood is ready for the gospel.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200513" id="p65">When working with referrals, remember to:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200529" id="p74">Contact the referring member or missionaries to learn more about how to best help the person. The referring member or missionaries (with their mission president’s approval) may want to counsel with you or assist you through technology with the teaching.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200515" id="p66">Attempt to promptly make an initial contact with the referred individual through a call, text, email, or other communication. Arrange a visit as soon as possible. If the person does not respond, leave a message and try again later.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200536" id="p75">Family history or genealogy provides another way you can find people to teach. Family history is now one of the most widespread hobbies in the world. What we sometimes refer to as the spirit of Elijah is “the distinctive influence of the Holy Ghost [that] draws people to identify, document, and cherish their ancestors and family members—both past and present” (David A. Bednar, “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2011/10/the-hearts-of-the-children-shall-turn?lang=eng&amp;para=p22#p22">The Hearts of the Children Shall Turn</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> Nov. 2011, 25; see also Russell M. Nelson, “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1998/04/a-new-harvest-time?lang=eng&amp;para=p15#p15">A New Harvest Time</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1998, 34). Throughout the world, the Spirit is influencing millions of people to search for their ancestors. People can often feel the Spirit as they talk about families. Many want a stronger connection with their extended family. This can lead to a desire to find a connection and identity as part of God’s family. Ancestors eager for their ordinances are praying for their posterity on earth to accept your teachings and perform those ordinances vicariously for them in the temple.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199631" id="p76">
      Determine what types of family history resources are available in your area. For example, you might provide a copy of the
      <cite>My Family</cite> booklet or introduce the people you are teaching to a temple and family history consultant or other member who can help them learn about <span class="language" lang="eng">FamilySearch.org</span>. Involve members so that those you are teaching will meet people who can friendship them. Explain that services on <span class="language" lang="eng">FamilySearch.org</span> are offered free of charge.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128199632" id="p77">
      For many people, family history is about discovering and capturing family stories and photos and recording the dates of important life events. You can help those you are teaching record this information on
      <span class="language" lang="eng">FamilySearch.org</span> or in the <cite>My Family</cite> booklet. It is also a good idea to share your own family stories and photos, when appropriate, with those you meet or teach.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="137171556" id="p174">As you invite others to share memories of their loved ones, they may feel the Holy Ghost testifying to them about the importance of family in God’s plan. These moments can lead to natural conversations about the purpose of life, God’s plan of happiness, and the role of the Savior in that plan.</p>

    <p data-aid="128199644" id="p86">Read the following account related by a senior missionary. Note the role family history played in the couple’s conversion.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199645" id="p87">Mildred Schultz was a devout member of her church. It was no surprise that when the missionaries knocked on her door, she wasted no time in inviting them in so that she could teach them the “truth.” As the missionaries taught, she was touched by the truths of the restored gospel and was baptized. Throughout the teaching process, her husband, Frank, chose not to listen.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199646" id="p88">This is where I come into the picture. The elders introduced us to Sister Schultz. We helped her begin her family tree and then invited her to meet us at the family history center. The day came for our meeting, and Frank asked if he might come along so that he could search for his ancestors as well. Of course, she was thrilled at the prospect, and they headed off to the center.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199647" id="p89">The elders had planned to meet us there later during the day. Before they arrived, we showed Frank and Mildred the library and introduced them to Sister Wright. Sister Wright was the family history specialist, and she offered to help find information about Frank’s father. She found his name in a book and was also able to provide Frank with a map of Germany that showed the location of his father’s birth. He was so excited about these discoveries that when the elders came, he invited them to dinner to show them pictures and share his family history. The Spirit of Elijah had touched and softened his heart and had opened a door for the gospel to fill his life.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199648" id="p90">That evening, Mildred pondered what she might say to help Frank become more interested in the gospel. A question came into her mind. “Frank,” she started, “do you want to be with me forever, even after this life is over? Do you want to have an eternal family?” He quickly said, “Oh, Mildred, of course I do. How can I do it?” This question is what she had been praying for. “Listen to what the missionaries have to say,” she responded. He agreed. As the elders taught, the warmth of the message of the Restoration melted away his doubts and fears. He readily accepted the truths the missionaries shared. He accepted the invitation to be baptized. Frank and Mildred have been strong and active in the Church ever since.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199649" id="p91">Frank and Mildred worked hard to complete the work so that the saving ordinances could be performed for their family. It was an exciting day when they were baptized in behalf of their family members. In the process of getting the temple work done, Brother Schultz had a dream about his father. He saw his father at the ranch that served as his childhood home. His father was standing beside his porch rocker, dressed in white and holding his arms out to his son. Frank awoke from the dream crying. He knew that his father had accepted the work they had done.</p>

Pray to be aware of opportunities to use family history in your finding efforts. People typically have spiritual feelings as they talk about families. People also feel the Spirit as they are taught about the doctrine concerning why we do family history work. In addition, convert retention is enhanced as new members are able to search their family roots and perform sacred ordinances in behalf of their ancestors.</p>

    <p data-aid="128199666" id="p93">People who have been taught previously are a valuable source for finding people to teach. There are many reasons why people stop meeting with missionaries. Reasons include missionaries being transferred, people going on vacation, missionaries stopping visits even though people are still expecting visits, and people believing that the missionaries have nothing new to teach them. Many people who have been taught previously say they would meet with missionaries again.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199667" id="p94">Review your area book often to identify people who have been taught previously. Prayerfully reflect on the information in the area book concerning how each person first came in contact with the Church, what they have been taught, how they have responded, and why they stopped receiving the lessons. If members have been involved in teaching and fellowshipping these people, ask the members what they remember about the experience. Based on this information, make plans to contact the person again.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199668" id="p95">If someone you are teaching chooses to stop learning about the gospel, record information in the area book that will be helpful for the missionaries who will contact them in the future.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199670" id="p97">Much to my surprise, I was called to labor in the same mission where my older sister had served a year earlier. After a few months in the mission field, I was transferred to one of the areas where my sister had served. Upon learning of my transfer, my sister wrote and asked me to visit a family that she and her companion had taught. She expressed the love and closeness she had with the Norman family and how disappointed she was when they discontinued investigating the Church.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199671" id="p98">My companion and I located the Normans and were warmly received by them. They accepted our invitation to again hear the restored gospel. I’m not sure what the difference was this time, but they were fully ready to accept our message. The entire family was baptized and confirmed.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199672" id="p99">After this experience, I wondered about other [people] my sister had worked with. I thought, “If it worked for the Normans, maybe it will work for other people she taught as well.” I decided to write my sister about the idea of contacting other people she had taught. She went through her journal and sent me the names of other [people] in the area.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199673" id="p100">My companion and I spent the next week contacting these people. To our delight, almost half of them accepted an invitation to hear the restored gospel again. Several of this group were baptized and confirmed. While meeting with these [people], we also asked them for referrals of their friends and acquaintances that would be interested in our message. As a result, we found additional people to teach. This was the busiest time of my mission.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200672" id="p133">When people choose not to learn more about the restored gospel, your work is not wasted. Your consistent efforts in serving and teaching as many people as you can are one way God prepares His children to eventually receive His servants. He often reaches out to His children through you. Even when people do not accept the opportunity to learn the gospel, your service and words are evidence of God’s love for them and may plant seeds that future missionaries and members of the Church will harvest.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200673" id="p134">When people do not accept the gospel, do not be discouraged. You have raised a warning voice. You have given them a clear choice. Disciples of Christ feel sorrow when people choose not to repent, but they maintain a vision of who they are and what they are doing. They continue to diligently move forward.</p>

          <p data-aid="128200686" id="p135">Read the following letter from a missionary to her parents: “I taught a wonderful lady on the bus. We were coming back from district [council], and it was the only empty seat so I sat down and started to look at my mail. Of course, the first one to be read was yours, with the baby pictures of Evan. I noticed that the eyes next to me were also looking at the pictures, and I looked over to meet eyes with an older woman. She gave me a half smile and looked out the window. She then closed her eyes like she was going to sleep. I prayed, ‘Heavenly Father, I want to talk to her. Please help me.’ A minute later she opened her eyes and sat up straight, and I quickly said, ‘Don’t you think he is cute?’ I showed her the pictures of baby Evan and started talking about families with her. I asked her about her kids, and she got teary-eyed and told me a story about how her daughter hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She cried and I cried with her. I told her about the plan of salvation and how Heavenly Father knows her and knows what she is going through. I cried and told her that I know that her daughter loves her because I am a daughter of a mother that loves me, and I love her. I explained that sometimes people make bad decisions and that her daughter has agency. She told me, smiling, ‘I bet your mother really misses you, and she will not let you go when she sees you again.’ She thanked me for talking with her and gave me her address so that we can share the gospel with her. As she was getting off the bus, she said, ‘I got on the wrong bus, but I didn’t get off. No one sat by me until you came … and look what happened.’ God’s plan is perfect!”</p>

  <p data-aid="128199220" id="p1">You are called to teach the restored gospel to as many people as will receive you. Teaching is central to everything you do. You develop Christlike attributes, study the missionary lessons, improve your ability to speak in your mission language, and rely on the Spirit in order to teach with convincing power. The Lord stated this very simply as a commandment with a promise:</p>
  <p data-aid="128199221" id="p2">“Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.21?lang=eng#p21">Doctrine and Covenants 11:21</a>).</p>
  <p data-aid="128199223" id="p3">“Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85?lang=eng#p85">Doctrine and Covenants 84:85</a>).</p>
  <p data-aid="128199225" id="p4">
    The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the [missionary lessons] but these should not be taught by rote presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the interest and needs of the
    <span class="page-break" data-page="178"></span>[individual]. Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, Dec. 11, 2002).
  </p>
  <p data-aid="128199226" id="p5">Learn to rely on the Spirit to give you what you should say and do. By studying, developing, and using the teaching skills in this chapter, you will become a more capable instrument in the hands of the Lord. The Spirit will draw upon the knowledge and skills you have developed to help you teach more powerfully. The quality and power of your teaching will help others understand and feel the importance the restored gospel has for them. Their understanding will be influenced by your personal worthiness. Their understanding will also be influenced by how well you focus your attention on them and listen and by how well you explain the gospel, use the scriptures, share your testimony, ask questions, and invite them to make and keep commitments.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199245" id="p6">The first few moments with people are very important. They must learn to trust you. Begin your first visit in a warm, respectful, genuine manner. Ask a few simple questions to help you understand their religious background and their expectations regarding your visits. For example, ask, “What role has religion played in your life?” Do not, however, ask personal questions that would make them uncomfortable.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199246" id="p7">Before you begin, ask all who are present to join with you in the lesson. Encourage them to turn off the television and remove other distractions so that the Spirit of the Lord will not be hindered.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199248" id="p8">Explain that you would like to begin and end each lesson in prayer. Suggest that you will offer the opening prayer. Pray simply but fervently that the Lord will bless the people you are teaching in every aspect of their lives, and especially that they can feel the truth of what you will teach.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199250" id="p9">
      Demonstrate sincere interest and love for them and faith in the converting power of the gospel (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.43-48?lang=eng#p43">Moroni 7:43–48</a>). As guided by the Spirit, you may express thoughts such as the following:

          As you accept our message, you will learn how to make covenants, or promises, with God. You will learn how to make changes to bring your lives in closer harmony with His teachings. You will want to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and be baptized by proper authority (see

    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199268" id="p20">
      Before teaching the doctrine in a lesson, consider giving a simple overview of what you are going to teach. Help people see that it will have personal relevance for them. Many of the people you teach have been prepared by the Lord (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/16.16-17?lang=eng#p16">Alma 16:16–17</a>). As you share spiritual experiences together in the first meeting, they will recognize you as servants of the Lord.

    <p data-aid="128199275" id="p21">Each person or family you teach is unique. Even though you will not understand all of their interests, achievements, needs, and concerns, you should seek to be sensitive to their circumstances. Regardless of needs or problems, all people are best helped as they accept and live the gospel. You will be able to adjust your teaching as you listen to the promptings of the Spirit.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199276" id="p22">
      Let the Spirit guide the order in which you present the lessons based on the needs, interests, questions, and situations of those you teach. You may use more than one meeting to teach the
      <span class="page-break" data-page="180"></span>principles in one lesson, and occasionally you may teach the contents of two lessons in a single meeting. Heavenly Father knows His children, so rely on inspiration to make these decisions as you teach. Pray for the gift of discernment, and pay attention to thoughts that come to your mind or feelings you have about what to teach.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128199278" id="p23">You will need to adjust your teaching to give more attention to those commitments that are more difficult for an individual to keep. For example, one person may easily accept the Book of Mormon as the word of God, while another may struggle to accept anything but the Bible. One person may have trouble giving up tobacco but will readily accept the law of tithing.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199280" id="p24">As you plan when to teach certain doctrinal principles, be sensitive about how much new information you share. Teach at a pace that is appropriate for the person. Some will progress faster or slower than others. Make sure that you ask enough questions and listen carefully to their answers so you have a firm understanding of how quickly and how well they are learning and applying the doctrine you are presenting.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199281" id="p25">Be sensitive to time. Most teaching appointments should not last beyond 45 minutes. A teaching visit can be completed, however, in 15 or 20 minutes if needed. If the person has only 15 minutes to meet with you, adjust your teaching to respect that limitation.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199283" id="p26">Trust in the promise that the Spirit will give you “in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.6?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 100:6</a>).</p>

When you speak, maintain eye contact with the person. When you are not speaking, pray for your companion and carefully observe the person’s responses.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199322" id="p29">Whenever possible invite members, preferably recent converts, to help you teach. The ideal situation is to include Church members who formerly belonged to the same church as the people you are teaching. Show the members a copy of the lesson, and discuss what you want them to teach. Discuss how to work together. For example, have the members, as appropriate, share how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson. Have them explain how they made the decision to join the Church. When members join in teaching, they will have the opportunity to feel the joy of missionary work. It also provides friendship for those you are teaching. President Thomas S. Monson taught:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199324" id="p30">During the teaching process [people] can be benefitted by the strength of a member couple’s testimony who have in recent years made the step to baptism and membership. In the Canadian Mission in Ontario and Quebec, where our family lived when I presided over the mission, we found that the majority of the population belonged to perhaps three dominant faiths: Roman Catholic, Anglican, and the United Church of Canada. In every city of the mission we arranged for a newly baptized family from each of these faiths to be available to the missionaries who were in the process of teaching new [people] so that such a member couple could accompany the missionary team on perhaps the second or third visit.</p>
      <p data-aid="128199325" id="p31">Can you appreciate, for example, when missionaries [were] working with those from the United Church of Canada, the strength of testimony of [a brother and sister] who had come from the United Church of Canada. [The husband] would say, “When I joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, … I found the truth in its entirety. You too can make the adjustment. You too can make the same decision. In fact, let us pick you up on Sunday morning so that we can sit together in church. Then you can hear and feel for yourself. We’ll be right by your side.”</p>
      <p data-aid="128199327" id="p32">Anthony and Edith Belfiglio became such a fellowshipping couple to those who had Roman Catholic roots. The result was the same. It can be done. And such converts stay converted. In addition, the couples chosen to fulfill this assignment put their own roots even deeper in the rich soil of the gospel. … Brother Belfiglio became [an] ordained [patriarch] (missionary training satellite broadcast, Apr. 25, 2003).</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199340" id="p33">The standard works of the Church are your basic sources for teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. You may also use the words of living prophets. There are many reasons why it is vital to use the scriptures as the basis for your teaching. For example:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199342" id="p34">
          The Lord and His prophets have instructed us to do so (see

A latter-day prophet counseled, “The words and the way they are used in the Book of Mormon by the Lord … should be used by us in teaching gospel principles” (Ezra Taft Benson, “<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1987/04/the-book-of-mormon-and-the-doctrine-and-covenants?lang=eng&amp;para=p23#p23">The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1987, 84).

    <p data-aid="128199350" id="p38">Your ability to teach with power from the scriptures comes in large measure from the time you personally spend studying them. As you daily feast upon the word, your ability to teach from the scriptures will improve. In addition, your invitations to study and ponder the scriptures will be more powerful because you are doing the same thing in your life. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ through studying the scriptures—particularly the Book of Mormon—and to gain a testimony that the scriptures are sources of revealed truth. When people come to believe the scriptures, you will be better able to help them understand the doctrine correctly. The following suggestions may help.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199352" id="p39"><strong>Introduce the scripture.</strong> Describe briefly the background and context of the passage you will use. Invite those you teach to look for particular points in the passage. When teaching people with a limited knowledge of the scriptures, you may need to begin by describing the contents of a passage, using language that they will understand. Below are examples of introducing a scripture:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199353" id="p40">“Here in Joseph Smith’s history we have Joseph’s own words telling what happened to him as he went into the grove to pray. He said, ‘I saw a pillar of light …’”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199355" id="p41">“In this passage the prophet Alma is teaching people who are poor to exercise their faith in the word of God. He compares the word of God to a seed that can be planted in our hearts. Will you begin reading verse …”</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199357" id="p42"><strong>Read the passage.</strong> Read the verses aloud or ask the person you are teaching to read aloud. Be sensitive to those who struggle to read. If a passage is difficult for them to understand, read with them carefully and help them understand the more difficult points. Or give them a simpler passage to read. You might also define difficult words or phrases:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199358" id="p43"><span class="page-break" data-page="183"></span>“Let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not [’upbraideth not’ means that God won’t find blame or fault] and it shall be given him” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/james/1.5?lang=eng#p5">James 1:5</a>).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199360" id="p44">Some scriptural passages are clear and need no explanation. For others you may take time to explain what has been read.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199361" id="p45"><strong>Apply the scripture.</strong> “Liken” the scriptures to yourself and to those you teach by showing how the principles are relevant today (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23?lang=eng#p23">1 Nephi 19:23</a>). Show them how they can apply the principles in their lives. As they do, they will come to know that the doctrine is true. Bear your testimony of the principle, and promise them blessings. For example:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199363" id="p46">“The people of Alma, like you, had heavy burdens placed on them, almost more than they could bear. But as they exercised faith and ‘cried mightily to God,’ He strengthened them so they could endure the challenges and then delivered them from their trials. Just as He did with these people, I know God will help you in your trials as you …”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199365" id="p47">“Alma’s instruction to the people at the waters of Mormon applies to us today. John, are you willing to …”</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199367" id="p48">The people you teach will differ widely in how they view sacred texts, how familiar they are with the Bible, how well they understand scriptural language, and how deeply they believe that the Bible contains God’s word. Help all people gain an appreciation for the scriptures. By effectively using the scriptures in your teaching, you can help them begin to study the scriptures on their own. After each visit, suggest specific chapters or verses for them to read. You might give them questions to consider as they read, which you can discuss in your next meeting. This will encourage them to study the scriptures daily in their homes and participate in Church meetings and classes where the scriptures are used.</p>

      <p data-aid="128199370" id="figure10_p1">Most religions have sacred texts or books of scripture, but their use and perception of them may be different from how members of the Church view scriptures. For example, you may need to explain that your marking of scriptures is evidence of your desire to understand and apply the teachings of the scriptures and is not a sign of disrespect. Help those you teach see that the standard works are important because they contain the word of the Lord as written by prophets of God and that we accept them as truth.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199396" id="p49">People are better able to believe the message of the Restoration of the gospel when they understand the message. President James E. Faust said: “Study, ponder, and teach from the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon and the New Testament. Know the truth so well that you can state it clearly. B. H. Roberts wrote, ‘To be known, the truth must be stated and the clearer and more complete the statement is, the better the opportunity will the Holy Spirit have for testifying to the souls of men that the work is true.’ [<cite>New Witnesses for God,</cite> 3 vols. (1909), 2:vii]. You cannot convert people beyond your own conversion” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1996/04/what-i-want-my-son-to-know-before-he-leaves-on-his-mission?lang=eng&amp;para=p27#p27">What I Want My Son to Know before He Leaves on His Mission</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1996, 41).</p>
    <p data-aid="128199398" id="p50">
      You are commanded to reason with and expound the scriptures when you teach (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.1?lang=eng#p1">Doctrine and Covenants 68:1</a>). <i>Expound</i> means to enlarge on and to explain clearly. Expounding the gospel means that you explain the meaning of the doctrine and scriptural passages simply and clearly, relying on the Spirit to guide what you say. Use dignified but conversational language to help people understand the doctrinal principles. Ask questions to help them think about the principles and to see if they understand and accept what you have taught.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128199400" id="p51">At the end of each of the first three lessons in chapter 3 is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. Part of teaching for understanding is to make sure you explain words, phrases, and ideas so that other people understand you better. You can improve your ability to explain the gospel by:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199401" id="p52">Understanding the words you use.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199403" id="p53">Defining words others may not understand. Many words that mean special things to members of the Church are defined simply in approved Church resources.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199405" id="p54">Asking people questions like, “Do you know what we mean when we say … ?” or “Can you restate what we just talked about in your own words?”</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199407" id="p55">As you study the doctrine in chapter 3, identify words you think may be difficult for someone to understand. As you teach the doctrine in chapter 3, make notes of words, phrases, and ideas that those you teach have a hard time understanding. Define those words using the resources mentioned above. Test your definitions with people you are teaching and recent converts.</p>

    <p data-aid="128199450" id="p56">Jesus Christ often asked questions to help people ponder and apply principles. His questions prompted thought, soul searching, and commitment.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199451" id="p57">Good questions will help you understand interests, concerns, or questions that others have. They can enhance your teaching, invite the Spirit, and help people learn.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199453" id="p58">Poor questions can intimidate, irritate, and offend people. They can also cause you to lose control of the teaching situation. Try to ask questions that:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199455" id="p59">Are simple and easy to understand.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199456" id="p60">Help people think about what you are teaching.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199457" id="p61">Help you determine how well they understand what you are teaching.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199458" id="p62">Help people apply what they learn.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199459" id="p63">As those you teach respond to these types of questions, they will feel that they can talk openly. Good questions can lead people to ask you questions when they don’t understand, when they have a concern, or when they want to know what to do. Good questions can help those you teach share their feelings and by so doing discover a growing testimony. Examples of effective questions include:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199460" id="p64">What questions do you have about what we have taught?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199461" id="p65">Do you believe that Heavenly Father loves you? Why?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199462" id="p66">How do we sometimes make the same error as the people in this story?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199463" id="p67"><span class="page-break" data-page="186"></span>To help those you teach prepare to answer questions, you may want to say, “As I explain the importance of keeping the Sabbath day holy, ask yourself, ‘What does this commandment mean to me?’” Avoid asking questions that:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199464" id="p68">Include more than one idea.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199465" id="p69">Pertain to doctrine you have not yet taught.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199466" id="p70">Do not have a clear purpose.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199467" id="p71">Interrogate and pry unnecessarily.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128199468" id="p72">Asking too many questions, especially in your first visit, gives the impression that you are conducting an “interrogation.” Do not ask people to give specific answers about unimportant or obvious details. This will turn a good teaching environment into a game of guessing. When you need a specific answer, it is best to ask a factual question or present the information in some other way. Avoid asking questions that might embarrass someone if they do not know the answers. Questions are most useful when asked after you have taught and testified about a key principle. Following are examples of less-effective questions:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199469" id="p73">Who was the first prophet? (Asked before teaching about dispensations.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199470" id="p74">How will keeping our bodies pure help us have the Spirit and show that we are willing to follow a prophet of God? (More than one idea.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128199471" id="p75">Is it important to know about God’s commandments? (Yes-no answer and too obvious.)</p>
      </li>

    <p data-aid="128199476" id="p79">Learn to ask questions as prompted by the Spirit. The right type of question at the right time can greatly help those you teach to learn the gospel and feel the Spirit. Likewise, the wrong type of question or a question at the wrong time can interfere with their learning. Asking appropriate questions at the right time requires that you are in tune with the Spirit, that you listen to those you are teaching, and that you focus throughout the teaching experience. Effective teaching can be hard work and requires concentration and effort on the part of you and your companion.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199485" id="p80">When you listen carefully to others, you understand them better. When they know that their thoughts and feelings are important to you, they are more likely to be receptive to your teachings, share personal experiences, and make commitments. As you listen, you will be able to more effectively adapt your teaching to their needs and interests.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199486" id="p81">Especially listen for the whisperings of the Spirit. As others share their feelings with you, thoughts or ideas may enter your mind that are directed by the Spirit. You will also be able to understand what others are trying to express.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199487" id="p82">
      While others talk to you, avoid the tendency to think about what you are going to say. Make sure you are really concentrating on the person speaking rather than planning your response. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “More important than speaking is listening. These people are not lifeless objects disguised as a baptismal statistic. They are children of God, our brothers and sisters, and they need what we have. Be genuine. Reach out sincerely. Ask these friends what matters most to
      <em>them.</em> What do <em>they</em> cherish, and what do <em>they</em> hold dear? And then listen. If the setting is right, you might ask what their fears are, what they yearn for, or what they feel is missing in their lives. I promise you that <em>something</em> in what they say will <em>always</em> highlight a truth of the gospel about which you can bear testimony and about which you can then offer more. … If we listen with love, we won’t need to wonder what to say. It will be given to us—by the Spirit and by our friends” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me?lang=eng&amp;para=p19#p19">Witnesses unto Me</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 2001, 15; italics in original).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128199488" id="p83">People also communicate by the way they sit, their facial expressions, what they do with their hands, their tone of voice, and the movements of their eyes. Observe these unspoken messages; they can help you understand the feelings of those you teach. Also be aware of your own body language. Send a message of interest and enthusiasm by listening sincerely.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199489" id="p84">Do not be afraid of silence. People often need time to think about and reply to questions or to express what they are feeling. You might pause after you have asked a question, after sharing a spiritual experience, or when people are having difficulty expressing themselves. Be sure to give people time to complete their thoughts before you respond, and do not interrupt while they are talking.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199490" id="p85">When you feel that you understand what is being said, make comments that show you understand, such as “So what you are saying is _____. Is that right?” or “If I understand, you are feeling that _____.” When you are not sure if you understand, ask the person for clarification.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199491" id="p86">Some people may tend to dominate the conversation and keep you from teaching the restored gospel. You will need to learn to take control of such situations tactfully. For example, “We appreciate what you are sharing with us, but that is an issue we would like to discuss later. I will ask my companion to write it down so we will be sure not to forget to treat it on a later visit.” Remember, you will help people most by teaching them the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199492" id="p87">As you listen carefully, the Spirit will help you know what to say. Listening takes effort and concentration. One missionary shared the following true experience (the names have been changed):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128199493" id="p88">
        My companion and I were teaching the Sanchez family. It was hot and the children were making a lot of noise. I asked Sister Sanchez about her reading in the Book of Mormon. As she began to explain, I noticed that their son had grabbed my companion’s notebook and was running around the room waving it in the air. Although I was looking at Sister Sanchez, my mind was elsewhere. I thought to myself,
        <span class="page-break" data-page="188"></span>“It’s so hot, and I wish their little boy would settle down. This just isn’t going to work.” As my mind wandered, I noticed that Sister Sanchez was struggling to talk. A subtle impression came into my mind to listen. I fought to tune out the heat and the noise. I carefully watched her face as she spoke. She looked down at the ground, then back up at my companion and me. Her husband was hopelessly trying to quiet the children. There was a pause, and then with trembling in her voice she said, “I did what you asked. I read those chapters you wanted me to, and I prayed.” Again she paused and looked down. She glanced at her children, then her eyes met mine. “I got an answer,” she said with a smile and with tear-filled eyes. “It’s true, I know it’s true.” The Spirit filled the room. With a heart full of gratitude that I had listened, I smiled and said, “Yes, it is.”

    <p data-aid="128199516" id="p89">Some of those you teach will lack the faith to keep commitments, others will face opposition, and others will not always accept everything you share. They must make their own choices, but you will want to do all you can to answer their questions, help them resolve their concerns, and overcome opposition.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199517" id="p90">
      Sometimes people’s concerns are like an iceberg. Only a small portion is visible above the surface. These concerns can be complex and difficult to resolve. For this reason, you need to follow the Spirit and respond in a manner best suited to the situation.
      <span class="page-break" data-page="189"></span>Pray for the gift of discernment and follow your impressions. Heavenly Father knows the hearts and experiences of all people (the complete iceberg) and will help you know what is best for each person.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128200182" id="p91">When you help others resolve their concerns, first seek to understand their concerns by asking questions and listening. Rely on the Spirit to help you know how to help them resolve their concerns. For example, you might use a scripture to address a concern about the need for baptism, or you might share your testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200184" id="p92">Often concerns are more social than doctrinal. For example, some people might fear opposition from family members if they join the Church. Or they might fear rejection from their friends at work. Whatever the concern may be, they may have past experiences or other influences that are part of the concern that you do not understand. In many cases, members may be able to help you understand and help with their concerns.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200186" id="p93">How you approach an individual’s concern will depend on the nature of that concern. Determine whether the concern has come up because the person does not have a spiritual confirmation of the truth of the Restoration or whether the person does not want to commit to living a true principle. Understanding the source of the problem in this way helps you know whether to focus on testimony or commitment.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200193" id="p94">
      Repentance is a spiritual process that involves humility, confession, restitution, and turning away from the sin. It is a continual commitment to improve our thoughts and actions as we work to become more like the Savior. Even when sins are repeated, repentance is available as a means of healing (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.30?lang=eng#p30">Mosiah 26:30</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.8?lang=eng#p8">Moroni 6:8</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.31-32?lang=eng#p31">Doctrine and Covenants 1:31–32</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128200195" id="p95">Repentance may involve an emotional and physical process. People must stop ongoing, ingrained ways of inappropriate acting. Undesirable actions must be replaced with healthy and appropriate behaviors.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200196" id="p96">Sometimes converts, even with the best of intentions, give in to temptation as they progress toward greater self-discipline. Thus, both repentance and recovery may take considerable time. In such cases new converts seek the Lord’s help, and if necessary, work with their priesthood leaders (not with the missionaries) as they seek to overcome temptation and to fully repent.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200198" id="p97">Through baptism and confirmation people receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which will strengthen their ability to overcome these challenges. But baptism and confirmation may not fully do away with the emotional and physical urges that go along with these behaviors. Even though a person may have some initial success, further emotional healing may be necessary to completely repent and recover.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200211" id="p98">You may be asked to answer questions and concerns about addiction. You may also want to help people find answers to difficult questions related to these problems. The best thing you can do is to refer them to local priesthood leaders and encourage them to become familiar with the Church’s online Addiction Recovery Program. You may also want to encourage local Church leaders to access this same resource. Local leaders can also refer to the Church’s Provident Living website.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200263" id="p119">Latter-day Saints can best help new members remain active by being their friends. Members should reach out to those you are teaching and to new converts with a warm, positive attitude. Visitors and new converts will often respond favorably when greeted with a smile, when sincerely asked about how they are doing, when others sit by them during meetings, and when they are invited to a family dinner or home evening.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200266" id="p120">
      Because it is likely that some people may return to an addiction, priesthood leaders and members
      <span class="page-break" data-page="191"></span>should not be shocked or discouraged if they learn that someone you are teaching or a new member may be struggling with such problems. They should show love toward the individual and not be judgmental if the person yields to an old craving. They should treat it as a temporary and understandable setback. Condemning the person being taught or the new convert is never helpful and may lead to discouragement, feelings of failure, and inactivity. A new convert who suddenly stops attending church may have given in to an old addiction and may be feeling unworthy and discouraged. An immediate visit giving encouragement and support can help the person succeed. Members should show in word and action that the Church is a place where the love of Christ can be found (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.32?lang=eng#p32">3 Nephi 18:32</a>). Elder Dale G. Renlund has counseled, “We must not only be tolerant while others work on their individual illnesses; we must also be kind, patient, supportive, and understanding” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/2015/04/latter-day-saints-keep-on-trying?lang=eng&amp;para=p17#p17">Latter-day Saints Keep on Trying</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> May 2015, 57).

Now try to go one day without doing it once. When you succeed, try to go a whole week without doing it. Discuss your experience with your companion. Then try to imagine how much harder it is for someone you are teaching to conquer an addiction to pornography or harmful substances such as tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200281" id="p122">At the conclusion of each teaching visit, provide the people you teach with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting. You might assign them chapters from the Book of Mormon to study or encourage them to use approved Church resources (both print and digital), such as Gospel Library, to find answers to a concern, research a topic, or watch a video. The people you teach should always be given something to think about, to ponder, and to pray about. This can become an opening topic of discussion the next time you meet.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200293" id="p123">Some of the people whom you will teach may not believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ or have a Christian tradition. Many of these people, however, will have beliefs, practices, and places which they hold sacred. As a servant of God, it is essential that you show proper respect for their religious beliefs and traditions. Do not do anything that would show disrespect for that which is important to them.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200296" id="p124"><span class="page-break" data-page="192"></span>You may wonder how you should adjust your teaching approach for these people. It will be helpful to remember that in order to be converted, all of God’s children, regardless of background, must develop faith in Jesus Christ, repent, receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, and endure to the end by keeping the commandments and giving service. The principles that help others build faith in Jesus Christ are the same in all cultures. You can find valuable resources for teaching those without a Christian background in Gospel Library under the “Missionary” section.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200299" id="p125">You can help people gain a correct understanding of God as our Heavenly Father and develop faith in Jesus Christ by helping them have personal spiritual experiences rather than simply telling them about the nature of God. For example, you will help people gain this understanding as they:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200302" id="p126">Gain a spiritual conviction that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200304" id="p127">Hear your sincere teaching and testimony of the gospel, including why you chose to follow Jesus Christ.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200307" id="p128">Frequently hear you and other members talk to Heavenly Father in a simple, heartfelt prayer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200310" id="p129">Hear you bear powerful testimony.</p>

      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200315" id="p131">Come to learn how you feel about the scriptures as you read and discuss them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200318" id="p132">Read God’s word from the scriptures daily (especially the Book of Mormon).</p>

      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200326" id="p135">Keep the commandments.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128200329" id="p136">These activities are beneficial for all people you teach, but they are essential when teaching those without a Christian background because these people are less likely to have had these experiences previously.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200331" id="p137">Many converts from non-Christian backgrounds report that they did not understand much of what the missionaries were saying but that they felt the Spirit and wanted to do what the missionaries asked. Do all you can to help people understand the doctrine of the gospel. Be patient and supportive, as it may take some time for people to learn to identify and express the feelings they have inside. You may need to adjust the pace and depth of your teaching to help them understand. As you prepare to teach those without a Christian background, the following suggestions may help:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200334" id="p138">Provide simple overviews and reviews for each lesson.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200337" id="p139">Ask them to tell you what they understand and what they have experienced.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200340" id="p140">Take the time to define essential words and principles. Those you teach may not be familiar with many of the words you will use as you teach.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200342" id="p141">Return to a previously taught lesson to teach the doctrine more clearly. This may be necessary any time in the teaching process.</p>

      As a missionary, you desire the salvation of souls (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28.3?lang=eng#p3">Mosiah 28:3</a>). You know that people can come unto Christ and be saved only on conditions of repentance (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10-16?lang=eng#p10">Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–16</a>). One way to fulfill your desires is to cry repentance (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.49?lang=eng#p49">Alma 5:49</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15.6?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 15:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/16.6?lang=eng#p6">16:6</a>) and boldly invite people to exercise faith unto repentance, to be baptized by water and the Spirit, and to endure faithfully to the end (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.16-20?lang=eng#p16">3 Nephi 27:16–20</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/7.10?lang=eng#p10">Mormon 7:10</a>).
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128199532" id="p2">Commitment is an essential part of repentance. It is the act of obligating oneself to a course of action and then diligently following through on that decision. When people are genuinely committed, they have real intent, meaning that they fully intend to do what they have committed to do. They make an unwavering and earnest decision to change. They become devoted to Christ and dedicate themselves to His gospel. Keeping their commitment is how they “truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>). When you ask for commitments as part of your teaching, you are inviting people to repent.</p>
    <p data-aid="137163570" id="p60"><span class="page-break" data-page="198"></span>Commitment is also an essential part of making and keeping covenants. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: “When you teach [people] to keep their commitments, you are teaching them to become covenant-keepers” (“Making and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, April 25, 1997). People who keep commitments before baptism are more likely to make and keep covenants after baptism. Making and keeping covenants is an essential part of the gospel of Jesus Christ and God’s plan for His children.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199533" id="p3">One of the best ways to help people make and keep commitments is to extend an invitation. Extending and following up on invitations is vital because:</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199622" id="p30">A testimony is a spiritual witness and assurance given by the Holy Ghost. To bear testimony is to give a simple, direct declaration of belief—a feeling, an assurance, a conviction of gospel truth. Sharing your testimony often is one of the most powerful ways of inviting the Spirit and helping others feel the Spirit. It adds a current, personal witness to the truths you have taught from the scriptures. An effective missionary teaches, testifies, and invites others to do things that build faith in Jesus Christ. This includes making promises that come from living true principles. For example, a missionary might say, “I know as you keep the Sabbath day holy, you will find more peace in your heart.”</p>
    <aside class="quote" id="aside1">
      <p data-aid="128199623" id="aside1_p1">“Regarding one’s testimony, remember, that which one willingly shares he keeps, while that which he selfishly keeps he loses. … Teach and testify. There is no better combination.”</p>

    </aside>
    <p data-aid="128199626" id="p31">For your testimony to have convincing power, you must be sincere. Powerful testimony is not dependent on eloquence or the volume of your voice but on the conviction of your heart. Strive daily to strengthen your understanding and conviction of the doctrine and principles you are to teach. Bear testimony often to seal the truth of the principles or doctrine you are teaching. As often as possible, teach, then testify, and testify as you teach.</p>

    <p data-aid="128199627" id="p32">Your testimony may be as simple as “Jesus Christ is the Son of God” or “I have learned for myself that the Book of Mormon is true.” You may also share a brief experience about how you gained this knowledge. Bear testimony several times in each lesson, not just at the end. Bear testimony that what your companion has taught is from God. Bear testimony that the principle you are going to teach will bless the person’s life if he or she will follow it. Talk about how living a principle has blessed your life.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199628" id="p33">People may sometimes intellectually question what you teach, but it is difficult to question a sincere, heartfelt testimony. When you testify, pray that those you are teaching will feel the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost. When you testify, you help create an environment for people to feel the Holy Ghost confirming your witness of the truth. This prepares them to accept the invitations you will extend.</p>

      Brigham Young was not baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the first year of his learning about the restored gospel. But of his conversion he said: “If all the talent, tact, wisdom, and refinement of the world had been sent to me with the Book of Mormon, and had declared, in the most exalted of earthly eloquence, the truth of it, undertaking to prove it by learning and worldly wisdom, they would have been to me like smoke which arises only to vanish away. But when I saw a man without eloquence or talents for public speaking, who could only say, ‘I know by the power of the
      <span class="page-break" data-page="202"></span>Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord,’ the Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminated my understanding, and a light, glory, and immortality were before me. I was encircled by them, filled with them, and I knew for myself that the testimony of the man was true” (in <cite>Journal of Discourses,</cite> 1:90).

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200572" id="p35">Extending an invitation without following up is like beginning a journey without finishing it or buying a ticket to a concert without going into the theater. Without the completed action, the commitment is hollow.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200574" id="p36">Change can be hard. Your role is to help strengthen people in their resolve to change. You should do all you can to help people keep their commitments.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200576" id="p37">
      Genuine repentance is best demonstrated by righteous actions over a period of time, especially for commandments such as chastity, the Word of Wisdom, and tithing. As you and ward leaders work with people to help them keep their commitments, show understanding. Be patient but persistent. You have not finished your ministry until people are living these commitments, or in other words, until they have repented (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.32?lang=eng#p32">3 Nephi 18:32</a>). Sometimes several visits may be necessary for you to help people develop strong enough faith in a principle to lead to repentance.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="128200578" id="p38">Following up begins when you first visit and teach people:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200580" id="p39">Have them record their commitment, perhaps on their phone or calendar or on something you leave with them, such as a card with your names and phone number.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200581" id="p40">Make sure people know that you or member friends will make brief contact with them daily between teaching appointments. Determine which method of communication they would prefer (brief visit, phone call, text message, email, social media message, and so on). Explain that your purpose in following up is to support and help them. Give them an idea of what you will do when you make contact each day. Be respectful of people’s time and wishes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="137163572" id="p61"><span class="page-break" data-page="203"></span>Make daily contact positive and comfortable to encourage and uplift those you teach.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p data-aid="128200583" id="p41">Record specific notes to follow up tomorrow on every invitation you have extended today.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-aid="128200585" id="p42">Make frequent contact, daily if possible, to find out how people are progressing with their commitments, answer questions, help them overcome challenges, teach additional lessons, read together from the Book of Mormon, share passages of scripture, introduce them to members, or share relevant Church media. As you contact and visit people often, you will strengthen the spiritual feelings they felt as you taught them the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This sustaining influence of the Spirit is vital. There may be times when you call the people you are teaching to remind and encourage them to keep a commitment.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200587" id="p43">Help people identify the blessings they have received as they have kept their commitments. Especially help them describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness of the message.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200588" id="p44">Compliment and encourage people who are succeeding in keeping commitments. The people you are teaching are changing their lives. They have a lot to learn and to do. Sincerely and frequently praise them. Express your gratitude for their progress and your confidence that they can succeed. Encourage them whenever you are with them.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199676" id="p45">Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128199790" id="p1">The purpose of your teaching is to help others develop faith in Jesus Christ and repent of their sins. As Mormon taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.25?lang=eng#p25">Moroni 8:25</a>). The baptismal interview is the way established by the Church to ensure that each candidate meets the Lord’s standards for baptism and is prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Through this interview, baptismal candidates fulfill the scriptural requirement that they witness before an authorized representative of the Church that they have “truly repented of all their sins” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>). The commitments that people make prepare them to make and keep the covenant of baptism, be confirmed a member of the Church, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, enter the temple with a limited-use recommend, and receive the Aaronic Priesthood (for males of the appropriate age). People who have kept the commitments that you invited them to make will be well prepared for the interview and for membership and activity in the Church.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199791" id="p2">As you teach people and prepare them for baptism and confirmation, make sure that they meet the qualifications for baptism. As they embark on the covenant path, remember that path leads to the holy temple, where they receive blessings necessary for eternal life.</p>

    <p data-aid="128199812" id="p3">When a person has set a firm baptismal date, schedule when you will complete all the events that lead to baptism and confirmation as listed in your daily planner. Carefully review the Teaching Record to ensure that you have taught the basic doctrine and that the candidates are prepared to address each question in the baptismal interview. Review this schedule with the person in your next meeting. If possible, the person should attend a baptismal service prior to his or her own baptism.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199813" id="p4">If you feel that the person you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule an interview until he or she meets the standards. If the candidate is a minor, ensure that the parents or guardians have given permission, preferably in writing, for him or her to be baptized.</p>
    <p data-aid="128199814" id="p5">As you help people prepare for their baptismal interview, talk to them about the purpose of the interview. Teach them and bear testimony about the sacredness of baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Explain that you want to make sure they understand the principles you have taught and the covenant they will make. Also explain that the interview is an opportunity for them to witness before the Lord’s representative that they are ready for these sacred ordinances. As they keep the baptismal covenant, they will receive a remission of sins. Share the questions the interviewer will ask about their belief in important gospel doctrine, their repentance of past sins, and their willingness to covenant to obey Jesus Christ throughout their lives. Emphasize that baptism by water is incomplete without baptism by fire through the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p data-aid="137171540" id="p60">Remind the person that immediately after baptism and confirmation, he or she is worthy and eligible to receive a limited-use recommend to enter the temple to perform baptisms for deceased ancestors, and males of the appropriate age may also be ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood. This will help set the person on the path toward making temple covenants that open the door to eternal life.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200895" id="p23">The Spirit is manifest strongly as the sacred ordinances of baptism and confirmation are performed. The baptismal service and subsequent confirmation should be spiritual highlights for new converts. You and the ward mission leader should do everything you can to ensure that the baptismal service is organized, inspiring, and memorable. These services should strengthen the new converts in their commitment to remain active.</p>

    <p data-aid="128200896" id="p24">Invite a member of the bishopric, quorum and auxiliary leaders, and ministering brothers and sisters (if assigned) to attend the baptismal service. Encourage the person being baptized to invite his or her friends and relatives (for example, by creating an event on social media) to attend the baptismal service and the sacrament meeting where the confirmation will take place. Consider inviting other people you are teaching to attend. These experiences will help them feel the Spirit and prepare them to accept an invitation to learn more about the gospel. Work with the person being baptized and the ward mission leader to invite the person’s friends and relatives to attend. Then follow through after the service to discuss their experience and invite them to learn why their friend chose to be baptized.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200897" id="p25">The missionaries who taught the person being baptized coordinate with the ward mission leader to organize the service. If a baptismal service is scheduled on a Sunday, it should be held at a time that minimizes interference with regular Sunday meetings. Explain to the person being baptized what is planned and why. Discuss proper dress, including how the person will be given white clothing to wear for the baptism. Agree on the place and time for the baptism. A member of the bishopric or the ward mission leader normally conducts the service. Following are essential items to plan and organize.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200898" id="p26">A baptismal service may include:</p>

      A person receives the ordinance of confirmation after he or she has been baptized (see
      <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.41?lang=eng#p41">Doctrine and Covenants 20:41</a>). A new convert is considered a member of the Church only after the ordinances of baptism and confirmation are both completed and properly recorded (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/3.5?lang=eng#p5">John 3:5</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33.11?lang=eng#p11">Doctrine and Covenants 33:11</a>). Converts are confirmed in a sacrament meeting in the ward where they live, preferably on the Sunday following their baptism. Converts are not confirmed at the baptismal service. The bishop is responsible for seeing that confirmation occurs as soon as reasonable after baptism. At least one member of the bishopric participates in the confirmation. The bishop should invite missionary elders who helped teach the convert to participate in the confirmation. Work closely with the bishop and the ward mission leader to make sure this essential ordinance is performed. The bishop does not conduct a separate interview for this ordinance.
    </p>
    <p data-aid="137171545" id="p65">After the confirmation, the bishop or ward clerk completes the confirmation information on the Baptism and Confirmation Form (Convert). The ward clerk then returns two copies of the form to the missionaries. The missionaries send one copy to the mission office for the creation of a membership record.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128200912" id="p38">Under the direction of the bishop, missionaries should continue to fellowship new members. Continue to teach them and review what has been taught. Encourage and support them, read the Book of Mormon with them, and help them share the gospel with family members and friends. As appropriate, continue throughout your life to communicate with those whom you have taught and to encourage and support them.</p>
    <p data-aid="128200913" id="p39">After the confirmation, teach all five missionary lessons again. Continue using the Teaching Record to record progress. Work closely with the ward mission leader and ward leadership to help the new convert stay active, build trusted relationships with local members, receive a limited-use temple recommend, and be ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood (for males of the appropriate age). Support new converts and help them receive all the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>

            President Henry B. Eyring explained why high standards are important. Discuss this counsel with your companion and evaluate how you feel about boldly helping people meet these standards. “The Lord sets His standards so that He can bless us. Think about those blessings: He promises those who meet the standards the help of the Holy Ghost. He promises personal peace. He promises the chance to receive holy ordinances in His house. And He promises those who endure in living His standards that they will have eternal life. … Because we love the people we serve, all of us want to do better in lifting our Heavenly Father’s children to the faithfulness and purity they need to have all the blessings of the Lord. … You begin by holding up the Lord’s standards clearly and without apology. And the more the world drifts from them and mocks them, the bolder we must be in doing that” (“Standards of Worthiness,”
            <cite>First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</cite> Jan. 2003, 10–11).

  <p data-aid="128201038" id="p1">You have the great opportunity of working with many leaders and members during your mission. Together you will strengthen and establish The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The relationships you establish with Church leaders will bless you for the rest of your life. These are important relationships as you and Church members seek to bring the restored gospel to Heavenly Father’s children. Understanding the basics of how to work within the ward organization will help you move forward with greater focus and power.</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128201042" id="p2">When converts are baptized and confirmed, they make sacred promises to obey and serve God and others for the rest of their lives. They become candidates for salvation in the celestial kingdom. To receive the promised blessings, they must endure to the end with faith in Jesus Christ. Church members are essential in helping new converts remain active and faithful.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201044" id="p3">President Gordon B. Hinckley said: “There is absolutely no point in doing missionary work unless we hold on to the fruits of that effort. The two must be inseparable. … Every convert is a great and serious responsibility” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p59#p59">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1999, 108).</p>
    <p data-aid="128201045" id="p4">Under the direction of the bishop, the ward council has first responsibility for strengthening new members and returning members. They make sure that new converts and returning members have friends, are nourished by the word of God, and receive callings and responsibilities. They may request that full-time missionaries help minister to and visit new members, returning members, and prospective elders. Preferably you will be paired with a member for such visits.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201047" id="p5">You are also responsible for these people. President Hinckley said: “You missionaries … are part of this responsibility of binding your converts to the Church. You may not be able to continue to visit them. But you can write to them occasionally and give them encouragement. … When you go home do not forget them. At all times live worthy of their trust. Write to them occasionally, assuring them of your love” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p75#p75">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” 109).</p>

    <p data-aid="128201049" id="p6">When attending Church meetings, you and your companion should sit with visitors or members you have been fellowshipping to support and strengthen them. You should not sit in a group with other missionaries.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201050" id="p7">A vital part of your mission is to establish the Church and strengthen the unit in which you serve. You do this in part by helping new converts remain active and by helping returning members become active. One of your duties is to lead out in teaching all five missionary lessons to new members after baptism and, when appropriate, to returning members. Ward missionaries and ministering brothers and sisters can also help teach these principles.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201052" id="p8">President Gordon B. Hinckley related the following concerning the challenges many new converts face:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p data-aid="128201054" id="p9">I received the other day a very interesting letter. It was written by a woman who joined the Church a year ago. She writes:</p>
      <p data-aid="128201055" id="p10">“My journey into the Church was unique and quite challenging. This past year has been the hardest year that I have ever lived in my life. It has also been the most rewarding. As a new member, I continue to be challenged every day.”</p>
      <p data-aid="128201057" id="p11">She goes on to say that when she joined the Church she did not feel support from the leadership in her ward. Her bishop seemed indifferent to her as a new member. Rebuffed, as she felt, she turned back to her mission president, who opened opportunities for her.</p>
      <p data-aid="128201059" id="p12">She states that “Church members don’t know what it is like to be a new member. … Therefore, it’s almost impossible for them to know how to support us.”</p>
      <p data-aid="128201060" id="p13">I challenge you, my brothers and sisters, that if you do not know what it is like, you try to imagine what it is like. It can be terribly lonely. It can be disappointing. It can be frightening. We of this Church are far more different from the world than we are prone to think we are. This woman goes on: “When we … become members of the Church, we are surprised to discover that we have entered into a completely foreign world, a world that has its own traditions, culture, and language. We discover that there is no one person or no one place of reference that we can turn to for guidance in our trip into this new world. At first the trip is exciting, our mistakes even amusing, then it becomes frustrating and eventually, the frustration turns into anger. And it’s at these stages of frustration and anger that we leave. We go back to the world from which we came, where we knew who we were, where we contributed, and where we could speak the language” [“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p60#p60">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” 108].</p>

      With approval from the mission president, local leaders may consider asking full-time missionaries to assist in ministering assignments on a limited basis. The mission president communicates this approval to the stake president, who informs bishops. When such approval is given, full-time missionaries are assigned primarily to work with new members, part-member families, and returning members (see

    <p data-aid="128201077" id="p15">Teaching and baptizing new converts is under the direction of your mission president. However, the work of proclaiming the gospel will move forward more powerfully when full-time missionaries and members coordinate their efforts and work in unity together. You may often be invited to attend ward council meetings. However, your first priority is to make sure that the people you are teaching are at church. Frequently this will mean that you will accompany them. If there is a conflict between attending ward council meeting and getting someone to church, do the latter. In this case, provide a copy of the Progress Record to the ward mission leader and ensure that he has all the information needed for ward council.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201079" id="p16">President Gordon B. Hinckley said:</p>
    <p data-aid="128201081" id="p17">“Every new convert needs three things:</p>
    <ol class="decimal" start="1">
      <li data-marker="“1.">
        <p data-aid="128201082" id="p18">A friend in the Church to whom he can constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his questions, who will understand his problems.</p>

        <p data-aid="128201084" id="p19">An assignment. Activity is the genius of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert deserves a responsibility. …</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="“3.">
        <p data-aid="128201086" id="p20">Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4?lang=eng#p4">Moro. 6:4</a>). It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants made at the time of baptism” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p65#p65">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” 108).</p>

    </header>
    <p data-aid="128201140" id="p40">The full-time mission president holds the keys for convert baptisms. Under his direction, full-time missionaries have primary responsibility for teaching the gospel to people not of our faith. However, the bishop oversees the person’s progress and friendshipping as he or she is being taught. The ward mission plan is carried out under the presiding authority of the bishop. The mission president meets regularly with stake presidents to make sure that full-time missionaries cooperate with local priesthood leaders. He coordinates missionary efforts and offers to help the stake president provide instruction in the principles and practices of missionary work.</p>

    <p data-aid="128201144" id="p41">Local Church leaders and members are your best allies. Respect them and strive to build good relationships with them. As you work with these leaders, remember that they have other responsibilities associated with their callings. Seek to be a blessing, not a burden, to the leaders of your stake and ward. Your attitude should be one of “How can we help?” Counsel with the bishop and ward mission leader concerning your plans and activities. Make sure that what you do supports the ward mission plan.</p>
    <p data-aid="128201145" id="p42">The roles of local priesthood leadership in missionary work are described below. Understanding their roles will help you better work with them.</p>

      </header>
      <p data-aid="128201203" id="p66">Bishops of many wards have found that developing a ward mission plan promotes ward missionary work. Such a plan may include goals, initiatives, and activities to help ward members invite people to hear the gospel. Individuals and families also benefit from developing such a plan to guide their missionary efforts.</p>
      <p data-aid="128201204" id="p67">Members should use every honorable means to find people who are willing to listen to the message of the Restoration. They should emphasize finding fathers, mothers, and children who will come into the Church as families. Following are some suggestions for bishops to consider in developing a mission plan.</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>
          <p data-aid="128201206" id="p68">
            Pray that the Lord will prepare the hearts of specific people to hear the gospel. Pray also to be sensitive to those whom He is preparing (see

          <p data-aid="128201262" id="p88">Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism:</p>
          <p data-aid="128201264" id="p89">
            “The feeling that came upon me was that of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. … This was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the Lord” (<cite>Gospel Doctrine,</cite>
            5th ed. [1939], 96).
          </p>
          <p data-aid="128201265" id="p90">Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism:</p>
          <p data-aid="128201267" id="p91">
            “Oh! that I could have kept that same spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment and passion of our souls” (<cite>Gospel Doctrine,</cite>
            96).
