<h2 data-aid="128199789" id="title2">Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199790" id="p1">The purpose of your teaching is to help 
others develop faith in Jesus Christ and repent of their sins. As Mormon
 taught, “the first fruits of repentance is baptism” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.25?lang=eng#p25">Moroni 8:25</a>).
 The baptismal interview is the way established by the Church to ensure 
that each candidate meets the Lord’s standards for baptism and is 
prepared to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Through this interview, 
baptismal candidates fulfill the scriptural requirement that they 
witness before an authorized representative of the Church that they have
 “truly repented of all their sins” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>).
 The commitments that people make prepare them to make and keep the 
covenant of baptism, be confirmed a member of the Church, receive the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, enter the temple with a limited-use recommend, 
and receive the Aaronic Priesthood (for males of the appropriate age). 
People who have kept the commitments that you invited them to make will 
be well prepared for the interview and for membership and activity in 
the Church.</p>
<p data-aid="128199791" id="p2">As you teach people and prepare them for
 baptism and confirmation, make sure that they meet the qualifications 
for baptism. As they embark on the covenant path, remember that path 
leads to the holy temple, where they receive blessings necessary for 
eternal life.</p>

<p data-aid="128199812" id="p3">When a person has set a firm baptismal 
date, schedule when you will complete all the events that lead to 
baptism and confirmation as listed in your daily planner. Carefully 
review the Teaching Record to ensure that you have taught the basic 
doctrine and that the candidates are prepared to address each question 
in the baptismal interview. Review this schedule with the person in your
 next meeting. If possible, the person should attend a baptismal service
 prior to his or her own baptism.</p>
<p data-aid="128199813" id="p4">If you feel that the person you are 
teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule an interview 
until he or she meets the standards. If the candidate is a minor, ensure
 that the parents or guardians have given permission, preferably in 
writing, for him or her to be baptized.</p>
<p data-aid="128199814" id="p5">As you help people prepare for their 
baptismal interview, talk to them about the purpose of the interview. 
Teach them and bear testimony about the sacredness of baptism and 
receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Explain that you want to make sure
 they understand the principles you have taught and the covenant they 
will make. Also explain that the interview is an opportunity for them to
 witness before the Lord’s representative that they are ready for these 
sacred ordinances. As they keep the baptismal covenant, they will 
receive a remission of sins. Share the questions the interviewer will 
ask about their belief in important gospel doctrine, their repentance of
 past sins, and their willingness to covenant to obey Jesus Christ 
throughout their lives. Emphasize that baptism by water is incomplete 
without baptism by fire through the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p data-aid="137171540" id="p60">Remind the person that immediately 
after baptism and confirmation, he or she is worthy and eligible to 
receive a limited-use recommend to enter the temple to perform baptisms 
for deceased ancestors, and males of the appropriate age may also be 
ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood. This will help set the person on the
 path toward making temple covenants that open the door to eternal life.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128200833" id="p6">The person conducting the interview 
should use the baptismal interview questions with the guidance of the 
Spirit to determine whether the baptismal candidate meets the 
qualifications described in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>. He should also adapt the questions to the age and maturity of the candidate.</p>
<p data-aid="128200834" id="p7">If a candidate does not qualify 
according to the baptismal interview questions, the baptism and 
confirmation should be postponed. The person should receive additional 
teaching by the full-time missionaries and fellowshipping from ward 
members.</p>
<p data-aid="128200835" id="p8">The district leader or zone leader who conducts the interview should:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128200836" id="p9">Hold the interview in a comfortable, 
private place, conducive to feeling the Spirit of the Lord. When 
interviewing a child, youth, or woman, the interviewer’s companion 
should be nearby in the adjoining room, foyer, or hall. If the person 
being interviewed desires, another adult may be invited to participate 
in the interview. Missionaries should avoid all circumstances that could
 be misunderstood (see “<a href="https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/multimedia/file/Preventin-and-Responding-to-Abuse--First-Presidency-Letter.pdf">Preventing and Responding to Abuse</a>,” First Presidency letter, March 26, 2018).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200840" id="p13">Make sure that the candidate understands the purpose of the interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200841" id="p14">Ask the baptismal interview questions.

baptism, the district leader or zone leader and other missionaries 
should handle the situation sensitively and privately. Assure the 
candidate that he or she can succeed, and explain that some 
transgressions require more time for thorough repentance. Explain that 
the sacred nature of the ordinance requires high standards of 
worthiness. Assure the candidate that you and others will do all you can
 to support him or her. Then faithfully follow through to keep your 
promise.</p>

 Sometimes a person may volunteer information about such sins as you

However, if they do not say anything but you think they may have a 
problem, prepare them for the baptismal interview by asking them if they
 have been involved in any of these sins. If you become aware of a 
serious sin, do not ask about the details of the sin. Do not schedule a 
baptismal date or make any promises about whether they will be cleared 
for baptism and confirmation. Express your love and review the principle
 of repentance and forgiveness. Kindly explain that these sins are 
serious and that a person with more maturity and experience (your

<p data-aid="128200896" id="p24">Invite a member of the bishopric, 
quorum and auxiliary leaders, and ministering brothers and sisters (if 
assigned) to attend the baptismal service. Encourage the person being 
baptized to invite his or her friends and relatives (for example, by 
creating an event on social media) to attend the baptismal service and 
the sacrament meeting where the confirmation will take place. Consider 
inviting other people you are teaching to attend. These experiences will
 help them feel the Spirit and prepare them to accept an invitation to 
learn more about the gospel. Work with the person being baptized and the
 ward mission leader to invite the person’s friends and relatives to 
attend. Then follow through after the service to discuss their 
experience and invite them to learn why their friend chose to be 
baptized.</p>
<p data-aid="128200897" id="p25">The missionaries who taught the person 
being baptized coordinate with the ward mission leader to organize the

held at a time that minimizes interference with regular Sunday meetings.
 Explain to the person being baptized what is planned and why. Discuss 
proper dress, including how the person will be given white clothing to 
wear for the baptism. Agree on the place and time for the baptism. A 
member of the bishopric or the ward mission leader normally conducts the
 service. Following are essential items to plan and organize.</p>
<p data-aid="128200898" id="p26">A baptismal service may include:</p>

 A new convert is considered a member of the Church only after the 
ordinances of baptism and confirmation are both completed and properly 
recorded (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3.5?lang=eng#p5">John 3:5</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33.11?lang=eng#p11">Doctrine and Covenants 33:11</a>).
 Converts are confirmed in a sacrament meeting in the ward where they 
live, preferably on the Sunday following their baptism. Converts are not
 confirmed at the baptismal service. The bishop is responsible for 
seeing that confirmation occurs as soon as reasonable after baptism. At 
least one member of the bishopric participates in the confirmation. The 
bishop should invite missionary elders who helped teach the convert to 
participate in the confirmation. Work closely with the bishop and the 
ward mission leader to make sure this essential ordinance is performed. 
The bishop does not conduct a separate interview for this ordinance.</p>
<p data-aid="137171545" id="p65">After the confirmation, the bishop or 
ward clerk completes the confirmation information on the Baptism and 
Confirmation Form (Convert). The ward clerk then returns two copies of 
the form to the missionaries. The missionaries send one copy to the 
mission office for the creation of a membership record.</p>

standards the help of the Holy Ghost. He promises personal peace. He 
promises the chance to receive holy ordinances in His house. And He 
promises those who endure in living His standards that they will have 
eternal life. … Because we love the people we serve, all of us want to 
do better in lifting our Heavenly Father’s children to the faithfulness 
and purity they need to have all the blessings of the Lord. … You begin 
by holding up the Lord’s standards clearly and without apology. And the
