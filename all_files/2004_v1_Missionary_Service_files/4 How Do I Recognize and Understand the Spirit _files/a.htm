<h2 data-aid="128200734" id="title2">Personal Revelation</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128200735" id="p1">Joseph Smith said, “Salvation cannot 
come without revelation; it is in vain for anyone to minister without 
it” (Discourse, between circa 26 June and circa 4 August 1839-A, as 
reported by Willard Richards, Church History Library, The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City). You will succeed in 
your work as you learn to receive and follow personal revelation. Joseph
 Smith also taught that revelation is vital for your daily work: “This 
is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by 
revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the 
kingdom are placed” (History, 1838–1856, volume D-1 [1 August 1842–1 
July 1843, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City]).</p>
<p data-aid="128200736" id="p2">God loves you and all His children. He 
is anxious to support you in your practical and specific challenges. You
 have been promised inspiration to know what to do and have been given 
the power to do it (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.15-16?lang=eng#p15">Doctrine and Covenants 43:15–16</a>).
 He will help you as you try to recognize and understand the Spirit 
through diligent scripture study. He will guide you to people who will 
receive the message of the Restoration. He will give you power to 
deliver the message and to testify of Christ and His gospel. He will 
shower His blessings upon you through the gift of the Holy Ghost. He 
asks that you remain worthy of this gift and that you ask, seek, and 
knock (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.7?lang=eng#p7">Doctrine and Covenants 4:7</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Matthew 7:7–8</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200737" id="p3">We live in the day prophesied by Book of
 Mormon prophets—a day when people will “contend one with another, and 
they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which 
giveth utterance” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.4?lang=eng#p4">2&nbsp;Nephi 28:4</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/29.6?lang=eng#p6">3&nbsp;Nephi 29:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Mormon 9:7–8</a>).
 Yet many people also yearn for spiritual things. As you learn to 
receive personal revelation, you will teach with power and authority 
(see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.3?lang=eng#p3">Alma 17:3</a>) because the Holy Ghost gives you power to speak (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.22?lang=eng#p22">1&nbsp;Nephi 10:22</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200738" id="p4">You need to seek and receive personal 
revelation through the Holy Ghost as you help people become baptized and
 confirmed. Have faith that you will receive personal revelation to 
guide you from day to day. The Holy Ghost will help you in every aspect 
of your work.</p>

<p data-aid="128200742" id="p5">A person is capable of receiving 
spiritual guidance before being baptized and confirmed. This spiritual 
influence begins with the Light of Christ, which “is given to every man,
 that he may know good from evil” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.16?lang=eng#p16">Moroni 7:16</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.14-19?lang=eng#p14">verses&nbsp;14–19</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200743" id="p6">“The light of Christ is just what the

persevering influence that comes upon mankind because of Jesus 
Christ.&nbsp;…</p>
<p data-aid="128200744" id="p7">“The light of Christ should not be 
confused with the personage of the Holy Ghost, for the light of Christ 
is not a personage at all. Its influence is preliminary to and 
preparatory to one’s receiving the Holy Ghost. The light of Christ will 
lead the honest soul who ‘hearkeneth to the voice’ to find the true 
gospel and the true Church and thereby receive the Holy Ghost” (Bible 
Dictionary, “<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/light-of-christ?lang=eng">Light of Christ</a>”; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.46-47?lang=eng#p46">Doctrine and Covenants 84:46–47</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200745" id="p8">President Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer said: “It 
is important for a … missionary … to know that the Holy Ghost can work 
through the Light of Christ. A teacher of gospel truths is not planting 
something foreign or even new into an adult or a child. Rather, the 
missionary or teacher is making contact with the Spirit of Christ 
already there. The gospel will have a familiar ‘ring’ to them” (“The 
Light of Christ” [address given at the seminar for new mission 
presidents, June 22, 2004], 2, Church History Library, Salt Lake City).</p>

 The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead. He is a personage of
 spirit and does not have a body of flesh and bones (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22?lang=eng#p22">Doctrine and Covenants 130:22</a>).

them (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14.26?lang=eng#p26">John 14:26</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200748" id="p10"><strong>The power of the Holy Ghost.</strong>
 The witness that comes to sincere seekers of truth before baptism comes
 through the power of the Holy Ghost. “The power [of the Holy Ghost] can
 come upon one before baptism and is the convincing witness that the 
gospel is true. By the power of the Holy Ghost a person receives a 
testimony of Jesus Christ and of His work and the work of His servants 
upon the earth” (Bible Dictionary, “<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/holy-ghost?lang=eng">Holy Ghost</a>”).
 The Holy Ghost testifies of truth. All people can know the truthfulness
 of the Book of Mormon through the power of the Holy Ghost. “By the 
power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.5?lang=eng#p5">Moroni 10:5</a>).</p>

 People who receive a witness but have not been baptized and confirmed 
do not yet have the promise of the constant companionship of the Holy 
Ghost. Joseph Smith said: “There is a difference between the Holy Ghost 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before
 he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the 
truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
 until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance 
upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would 
have left him” (“Sabbath Scene in Nauvoo,” <cite>Times and Seasons,</cite> Apr. 15, 1842, 752).</p>
<aside class="quote" id="aside1">
<p data-aid="128200750" id="aside1_p1">“The gift of the Holy Ghost comes

<p data-aid="128200754" id="p13">As a member of the Church, you have 
received the gift of the Holy Ghost by priesthood authority. This gift 
entitles you to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as you

<p data-aid="128200755" id="p14"><strong><a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/holy-ghost-mission-of?lang=eng">The Holy Spirit of Promise</a>.</strong> The Holy Ghost is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.3?lang=eng#p3">Doctrine and Covenants 88:3</a>).
 To be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that the Holy Ghost 
confirms that righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants are acceptable 
to God. The Holy Spirit of Promise testifies to the Father that the 
saving ordinances have been performed properly and that the covenants 
associated with them have been kept. Those who are sealed by the Holy 
Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.51-60?lang=eng#p51">Doctrine and Covenants 76:51–60</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/1.13-14?lang=eng#p13">Ephesians 1:13–14</a>). All covenants and performances must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise if they are to be valid after this life (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.7,18-19,26?lang=eng#p7">Doctrine and Covenants 132:7, 18–19, 26</a>). Breaking covenants may remove the sealing.</p>

 The gifts of the Spirit are special spiritual blessings that the Lord 
gives to worthy individuals for their own benefit and for their use in 
blessing others. For example, missionaries who must learn a new language
 may receive the gift of tongues to give them divine help in learning a 
language. Several gifts of the Spirit are described in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.8-18?lang=eng#p8">Moroni 10:8–18</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.11-33?lang=eng#p11">Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–33</a>; and <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.1-12?lang=eng#p1">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:1–12</a>.
 These are only some examples of the many gifts of the Spirit. The Lord 
may bless you in other ways depending on your faithfulness, your needs, 
and the needs of those you serve. You should desire spiritual gifts and 
earnestly seek for them (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.8?lang=eng#p8">Doctrine and Covenants 46:8</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.31?lang=eng#p31">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14.1,12?lang=eng#p1">14:1, 12</a>).

 individuals … feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the 
evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified 
and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases. These 
experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to
 experiment upon the word. This is how we come to <em>feel</em> the gospel is true” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time?lang=eng&amp;para=p9#p9">Now Is the Time</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> Nov. 2000, 75).</p>
<p data-aid="128200779" id="p27">The Holy Ghost works in the hearts of 
people to bring about these changes. As people choose to keep 
commitments, they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost more strongly 
and will develop the faith to obey Christ. Thus, you should help the 
people you work with grow in faith by inviting them to repent and to 
make and keep commitments.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128200802" id="p28">You can teach in the Lord’s way only by
 the power of the Spirit, and you receive the Spirit through the prayer 
of faith. The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the 
prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14?lang=eng#p14">Doctrine and Covenants 42:14</a>).
 As you pray for help in your teaching, the power of the Holy Ghost will
 carry your teachings “unto the hearts of the children of men” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.1?lang=eng#p1">2&nbsp;Nephi 33:1</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200803" id="p29">President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley illustrated this principle by relating an experience from his mission:</p>
<p data-aid="128200804" id="p30">“I always remember two young men who 
served in my mission. One was a superstar. He was educated. He was 
bright. He was quick. He was a little arrogant. We had another who was a
 sign painter. He came from a sign shop with very little education, but 
he knew his inadequacies and he relied on the Lord. When he prayed, you 
knew he was talking with the Lord. It wasn’t a rote thing, it was a 
conversation and that young man accomplished wonders while the other 
young man went through the motions. The power that was in the one and 
the absence of power in the other was so apparent. Call upon the Lord. 
He has extended the invitation, and He will answer” (<cite>Teachings of Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley</cite> [1997], 469).</p>

<p data-aid="128200805" id="p31">Strive to pray sincerely, with real intent, and with “all the energy of heart” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48?lang=eng#p48">Moroni 7:48</a>). Effective prayer requires great effort (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-4?lang=eng#p3">Moroni 10:3–4</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.10?lang=eng#p10">Doctrine and Covenants 8:10</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.7?lang=eng#p7">9:7</a>). Give serious thought to your attitude and to the words you use. Consider the following when you pray:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128200806" id="p32">Use the language of prayer, which shows
 that you love and respect your Heavenly Father. Use proper and 
respectful language in whatever language you speak. For example, in 
English use scriptural pronouns such as <i>Thee, Thou, Thy,</i> and <i>Thine.</i> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200807" id="p33">Always express gratitude for your 
blessings. A conscious effort to be grateful will help you recognize how
 merciful the Lord has been in your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200808" id="p34">Pray specifically for the guidance and 
help of the Holy Ghost. Show that you value this blessing by being 
sensitive to and aware of spiritual promptings. Then courageously follow
 those promptings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200809" id="p35">Pray with love and charity. Pray for 
people by name. Ask for inspiration to help you understand and meet 
their needs. Pray for the welfare of those you are teaching, new 
converts, and returning members. Pray for the members and priesthood and
 auxiliary leaders in your area. Pray for your family at home. Pray for 
your companion, other missionaries, and your mission president. Pray to 
know how you can help others, and then be willing to sacrifice in their 
behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200810" id="p36">Pray that you will be shown where to go
 and what to do. Pray that you will be led to those who are prepared to 
receive the message of the Restoration. Pray that you will recognize 
them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200811" id="p37">Recognize that your Heavenly Father knows what you need better than you do. Rely on the Spirit to know what to pray for (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19.24?lang=eng#p24">3&nbsp;Nephi 19:24</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.28,30?lang=eng#p28">Doctrine and Covenants 46:28, 30</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200812" id="p38">In your prayers at night, give the Lord
 an accounting of your day’s activities. Then review with Him your plan 
for the next day. Listen for the promptings of the Spirit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200813" id="p39">Pray to overcome temptation. Yielding to temptation interferes with the Spirit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200814" id="p40">Pray and, when appropriate, fast for special blessings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200815" id="p41">Pray about and ponder the scriptures. The scriptures open the window to revelation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200816" id="p42">Believe that God will answer your prayers. Recognize that God’s thoughts are not your thoughts (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/55.8-9?lang=eng#p8">Isaiah 55:8–9</a>), and trust God to answer your prayers in His own way and in His own time.</p>

<aside class="quote" id="aside2">
<p data-aid="128200817" id="aside2_p1">“Every morning&nbsp;…&nbsp;, 
missionaries should get on their knees and plead with the Lord to loosen
 their tongues and speak through them to the blessing of those they will
 be teaching. If they will do this, a new light will come into their 
lives. There will be greater enthusiasm for the work. They will come to 
know that in a very real sense, they are servants of the Lord speaking 
in His behalf. They will find a different response from those they 
teach. As they do so by the Spirit, [the people they are teaching] will 
respond under the influence of the same Spirit.”</p>

<p data-aid="128201822" id="figure6_p2">“The trouble with most of our 
prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and 
ordering groceries—we place our order and hang up. We need to meditate, 
contemplate, think of what we are praying about and for and then speak 
to the Lord as one man speaketh to another” (<cite>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Gordon&nbsp;B.

<p data-aid="128201823" id="figure6_p3">“If prayer is only a spasmodic 
cry at the time of crisis, then it is utterly selfish, and we come to 
think of God as a repairman or a service agency to help us only in our 
emergencies. We should remember the Most High day and night—always—not 
only at times when all other assistance has failed and we desperately 
need help” (<cite>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Howard&nbsp;W. Hunter</cite> [2015], <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-howard-w-hunter/chapter-4-help-from-on-high?lang=eng&amp;para=p31#p31">80</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201840" id="p43">The Spirit is always available to guide
 and direct you. However, the Spirit speaks quietly, through your 
feelings as well as your mind. One great challenge for you and those you
 work with is to recognize the quiet, subtle promptings of the Holy 
Ghost.</p>
<p data-aid="128201841" id="p44">President Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer taught: 
“The voice of the Spirit is described in the scripture as being neither 
‘loud’ nor ‘harsh.’ It is ‘not a voice of thunder, neither … voice of a 
great tumultuous noise.’ But rather, ‘a still voice of perfect mildness,
 as if it had been a whisper,’ and it can ‘pierce even to the very soul’
 and ‘cause [the heart] to burn.’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.3?lang=eng#p3">3&nbsp;Ne. 11:3</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.30?lang=eng#p30">Hel. 5:30</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/85.6-7?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 85:6–7</a>.)
 Remember, Elijah found the voice of the Lord was not in the wind, nor 
in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but was a ‘still small voice.’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.12?lang=eng#p12">1&nbsp;Kgs. 19:12</a>.)</p>
<p data-aid="128201842" id="p45">“The Spirit does not get our attention 
by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It 
caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at 
all.&nbsp;…</p>
<p data-aid="128201843" id="p46">“Occasionally it will press just firmly
 enough for us to pay heed. But most of the time, if we do not heed the 
gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come seeking 
and listening and say in our manner and expression, like Samuel of 
ancient times, ‘Speak [Lord], for thy servant heareth.’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/3.10?lang=eng#p10">1&nbsp;Sam. 3:10</a>.)” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1983/01/the-candle-of-the-lord?lang=eng&amp;para=p35#p35">The Candle of the Lord</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> Jan. 1983, 53).</p>
<p data-aid="128201844" id="p47">Many voices in the world compete for your attention, and they can easily drown out spiritual impressions if you are not careful.</p>

<p data-aid="128201903" id="p48">In answer to the question “How do we recognize the promptings of the Spirit?” President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley read <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.13,16-17?lang=eng#p13">Moroni 7:13, 16–17</a>
 and then said: “That’s the test, when all is said and done. Does it 
persuade one to do good, to rise, to stand tall, to do the right thing, 
to be kind, to be generous? Then it is of the Spirit of God.&nbsp;…</p>
<p data-aid="128201904" id="p49">“If it invites to do good, it is of 
God. If it inviteth to do evil, it is of the devil. … And if you are 
doing the right thing and if you are living the right way, you will know
 in your heart what the Spirit is saying to you.</p>
<p data-aid="128201905" id="p50">“You recognize the promptings of the 
Spirit by the fruits of the Spirit—that which enlighteneth, that which 
buildeth up, that which is positive and affirmative and uplifting and 
leads us to better thoughts and better words and better deeds is of the 
Spirit of God” (<cite>Teachings of Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley,</cite> 260–61).</p>
<p data-aid="128201906" id="p51">God answers your prayers through 
personal inspiration and revelation. Through the Holy Ghost He will 
guide you in your finding efforts, as you teach the restored gospel, and
 as you strengthen returning members and new converts. Your task is to 
live worthily, pray fervently, and learn to recognize and follow 
courageously the Spirit’s guidance.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201908" id="p52">As the Lord’s servant, you are to do 
His work in His way and by His power. Some missionaries feel confident 
that they know how to be successful. Others lack such confidence. 
Remember, however, that your confidence and faith should be in Christ, 
not in yourself. Rely on the Spirit rather than your own talents and 
abilities. Trust the Spirit to guide you in every aspect of your work. 
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Spirit is basic to teaching and
 preaching:</p>
<p data-aid="128201909" id="p53">“No man can preach the Gospel without 
the Holy Ghost” (History, 1838–1856, volume B-1 [1 September 1834–2 
November 1838], 756, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).</p>
<p data-aid="128201910" id="p54">“Some few were called and ordained by 
the Spirit of revelation and prophecy, and began to preach as the Spirit
 gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they strengthened by the
 power of God” (Orson Pratt, <cite>A[n] Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions</cite> [Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840], 24).</p>
<p data-aid="128201911" id="p55">“[Joseph Smith] proceeded to give 
instruction to the Elders respecting preaching the Gospel, and pressed 
upon them the necessity of getting the Spirit, so that they might preach
 with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven” (History, 1838–1856, volume 
C-1 [2 November 1838–31 July 1842], 969, Church History Library, The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).</p>
<p data-aid="128201912" id="p56">During your weekly and daily planning 
sessions, you will need to ask some basic questions every day—even many 
times each day (see the “Scripture Study” box that follows for examples 
of questions). Seek inspiration to answer these questions in a way that 
meets each situation. The answers should then take shape in your plans. 
But you should also be willing to follow the Spirit and change your 
plans when unforeseen opportunities arise.</p>
<p data-aid="128201913" id="p57">Study the following scriptures and 
consider how they answer these important questions that you should ask 
each day. Consider what these passages mean for your finding efforts, 
planning sessions, and personal and companion study. Also consider their
 meaning as you teach the lessons, invite people to make commitments, 
follow up on commitments, strengthen new members and returning members, 
and work with members.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128201956" id="title9">A Word of Caution</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128201957" id="p58">As you pray for inspiration, you should
 also confirm your feelings. For example, compare your decisions with 
the scriptures and the teachings of the living prophets. Be certain that
 the feelings are consistent with the assignment you have; for example, 
you will not receive revelation to tell a local bishop how he should 
perform in his calling. Discuss your decisions and conclusions with your
 companion, your district leader, or your mission president when 
appropriate.</p>
<p data-aid="128201958" id="p59">President Howard&nbsp;W. Hunter offered
 this counsel: “Let me offer a word of caution. … I think if we are not 
careful&nbsp;…&nbsp;, we may begin to try to counterfeit the true 
influence of the Spirit of the Lord by unworthy and manipulative means. I
 get concerned when it appears that strong emotion or free-flowing tears
 are equated with the presence of the Spirit. Certainly the Spirit of 
the Lord can bring strong emotional feelings, including tears, but that 
outward manifestation ought not to be confused with the presence of the 
Spirit itself” (<cite>The Teachings of Howard&nbsp;W. Hunter</cite> [1997], 184). The Spirit of the Lord always edifies.</p>
<p data-aid="128201959" id="p60">Revelation and spiritual experiences 
are sacred. They should be kept private and discussed only in 
appropriate situations. As a missionary, you may be more aware of 
spiritual experiences than you have been earlier in your life. Resist 
the temptation to talk freely about these experiences.</p>
<p data-aid="128201960" id="p61">President Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer 
counseled: “I have learned that strong, impressive spiritual experiences
 do not come to us very frequently. And when they do, they are generally
 for our own edification, instruction, or correction. Unless we are 
called by proper authority to do so, they do not position us to counsel 
or to correct others.</p>
<p data-aid="128201961" id="p62">“I have come to believe also that it is
 not wise to continually talk of unusual spiritual experiences. They are
 to be guarded with care and shared only when the Spirit itself prompts 
you to use them to the blessing of others” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1983/01/the-candle-of-the-lord?lang=eng&amp;para=p39#p39">The Candle of the Lord</a>,” 53).</p>
<aside class="quote" id="aside3">
<p data-aid="128201962" id="aside3_p1">“If worthy, we are entitled to 
receive revelations for ourselves, parents for their children, and 
members of the Church in their callings. But the right of revelation for
 others does not extend beyond our own stewardship.”</p>

occasions when you have been led by the Spirit or have experienced 
revelation or another gift of the Spirit. Think about when, where, and

prepare yourself for such an experience? How was the Lord’s hand 
manifest in the experience? How did you feel? What can you do to have 
similar experiences? Remembering these experiences can help you

<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128201985" id="p68">“Tell the brethren to be humble and 
faithful and be sure to keep the Spirit of the Lord, that it will lead 
them aright. Be careful and not turn away the still, small voice; it 
will teach them what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of 
the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their heart open to conviction, 
so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them their hearts will be ready to 
receive it. They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other 
spirits—it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take 
malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts, and their whole 
desire will be to do good” (quoted in <cite>Juvenile Instructor,</cite> July 19, 1873, 114).</p>
</blockquote>

Smith’s death. If you were in Brigham Young’s place and received this

<p data-aid="128202011" id="p91">Consider the following statement by President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks:</p>
<p data-aid="128202012" id="p92">“[A person may have] a strong desire to
 be led by the Spirit of the Lord but … unwisely extends that desire to 
the point of wanting to be led in <em>all</em> things. A desire to be 
led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an 
understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for our 
personal choices. Personal decision making is one of the sources of the 
growth we are meant to experience in mortality. Persons who try to shift
 all decision making to the Lord and plead for revelation in every 
choice will soon find circumstances in which they pray for guidance and 
don’t receive it. For example, this is likely to occur in those numerous
 circumstances in which the choices are trivial or either choice is 
acceptable.</p>
<p data-aid="128202013" id="p93">“We should study things out in our 
minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed within us. Then
 we should pray for guidance and act upon it if we receive it. If we do 
not receive guidance, we should act upon our best judgment. Persons who 
persist in seeking revelatory guidance on subjects on which the Lord has
 not chosen to direct us may concoct an answer out of their own fantasy 
or bias, or they may even receive an answer through the medium of false 
revelation” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1994/10/our-strengths-can-become-our-downfall?lang=eng&amp;para=p16#p16">Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> Oct. 1994, 13–14).</p>

hatch before its time. You can create a climate to foster growth, 
nourish, and protect; but you cannot force or compel: you must await the
 growth” (Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1983/01/the-candle-of-the-lord?lang=eng&amp;para=p44#p44">The Candle of the Lord</a>,”&nbsp;53).</p>
