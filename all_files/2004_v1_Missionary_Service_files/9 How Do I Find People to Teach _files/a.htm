<h2 data-aid="128200267" id="title2">Developing the Faith to Find</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128200270" id="p1">The doctrine and principles in this 
chapter will strengthen your faith that the Lord is preparing people to 
receive you and the restored gospel. He will lead you to them or He will
 lead them to you. Finding is different in different parts of the world.
 Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances. 
Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal.</p>
<p data-aid="128200273" id="p2"><strong>The Family of God.</strong> All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/17.26-29?lang=eng#p26">Acts 17:26–29</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/12.9?lang=eng#p9">Hebrews 12:9</a>).
 We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater 
blessings as members of His family in the life to come. We are all 
brothers and sisters in the family of God. This knowledge gives us a 
sense of identity and belonging. It gives us reason to hope for eternal 
life in God’s presence. We understand these basic truths because of the 
Restoration. Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is 
your responsibility and blessing. Like Alma seeking to help the apostate
 Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may 
have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord,
 their souls are precious&nbsp;…&nbsp;; therefore, give unto us, O Lord,
 power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto 
thee” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.34-35?lang=eng#p34">Alma 31:34–35</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200275" id="p3"><span class="page-break" data-page="160"></span><strong>“Find Them That Will Receive You.”</strong> You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.8?lang=eng#p8">Doctrine and Covenants 42:8</a>).
 Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants. They will 
be willing to act on your message. Many of these people have been “kept 
from the truth [only] because they know not where to find it” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.12?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 123:12</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200277" id="p4">Usually you do not know who these people
 are. They may not immediately recognize that you are the Lord’s 
servants. They may not understand that greater peace, direction, and 
purpose in life will come through the restored gospel than from anything
 else. They often do not realize that they are looking for the restored 
gospel until they have found it. For example, one convert said, “When I 
heard the gospel, it filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t know was 
there.” Another said, “I have finished the search I didn’t know I was 
on.”</p>
<p data-aid="128200280" id="p5">Wherever you are assigned to serve, 
remember that the Lord has “suffered you to come unto this place; for 
thus it was expedient in [Him] for the salvation of souls.” Work 
effectively to “lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts
 that [the Lord] shall put in your hearts.” If you do, you will receive 
the promise that “you shall not be confounded before men,” and “it shall
 be given you … in the very moment, what ye shall say” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.4-6?lang=eng#p4">Doctrine and Covenants 100:4–6</a>).
 Finding by the Spirit is as important as teaching by the Spirit. As in 
teaching, your efforts in finding will be effective if you are guided by
 the Spirit. Have faith that you will know what to teach and what to do 
to find those who will receive you.</p>

<p data-aid="128200314" id="p6">While the Prophet Joseph Smith was 
traveling with a group of missionaries on the Missouri River, the Lord 
revealed, “It is not needful for … mine elders to be moving swiftly … 
whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61.3?lang=eng#p3">Doctrine and Covenants 61:3</a>).
 As you move swiftly to planned activities, pray for the ability to see 
unplanned opportunities to serve and teach those who may be “perishing 
in unbelief.” Pray for the spiritual sensitivity to recognize <span class="page-break" data-page="161"></span>opportunities.
 You will find that God will place in your path His children who are 
being prepared to receive the restored gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="128200317" id="p7">Nothing happens in missionary work until
 you find someone to teach. Talk with as many people as you can each 
day. It is natural to be somewhat apprehensive about talking to people, 
but you can pray for the faith and strength to be more bold in opening 
your mouth to proclaim the restored gospel. Try applying the following 
ideas as you seek to talk with everyone you meet:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128200330" id="p12">Trust the Spirit to put into your heart and mind what to teach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200325" id="p10">Listen sincerely to what people say to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200327" id="p11">Be warm, authentic, friendly, and cheerful. Offer to help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200319" id="p8">Talk to people about their families. Help them see how the restored gospel can be a blessing to their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200322" id="p9">Offer to help them find the names of 
grandparents, great-grandparents, or other ancestors. Enlist the help of
 ward temple and family history consultants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200333" id="p13">Invite everyone to learn about the restored gospel.</p>

<p data-aid="128200336" id="p14">Offer pass-along cards.</p>
</li>

<p data-aid="128200338" id="p15">Ask for the names of people’s acquaintances who might be interested in your message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128200341" id="p16">As you read the following true account,
 look for how the man was prepared to receive the missionaries and how 
the missionaries used an unplanned opportunity to teach him the gospel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128200344" id="p17">As a child, I was never taught to read 
the Bible. I went to church on Sundays, but I contributed nothing and 
felt nothing in return. I was disillusioned. … I searched for … 
God—wanting to know if He even existed. I thirsted to know Him and His 
words. But I could not seem to find what I sought.</p>
<p data-aid="128200347" id="p18">There were moments when I felt close to
 quenching my thirst. When I held my first child, a daughter, in my arms
 for the first time, I had a feeling that God really did exist. Many 
years later, when her sister was born, I experienced the same feeling. …
 Most of the time, however, an inexplicable tiredness weighed upon my 
soul. I was spiritually thirsty and could find no place to drink.</p>
<p data-aid="128200349" id="p19">In April 1994 I was living in the city 
of Monterrey, Mexico, earning a living as a taxi driver. One day it 
rained for hours, sending water cascading down the mountainsides. After 
driving around in the rain for hours, I found myself in a little town 
about eight kilometers (five miles) from Monterrey. It was about … 
nearly time to go home. Suddenly I saw two young men on foot. They were 
wearing dark trousers and white shirts, and they looked drenched from 
head to foot.</p>
<p data-aid="128200352" id="p20">When I approached them, I opened the door of the taxi and called, “Get in! I’m going to Monterrey.”</p>
<p data-aid="128200355" id="p21">The taller one … replied, “We don’t have any money.”</p>
<p data-aid="128200358" id="p22">“No charge,” I replied.</p>
<p data-aid="128200360" id="p23">They quickly got into the taxi.</p>
<p data-aid="128200363" id="p24">As I drove, we talked. They asked if they could share a message about Jesus Christ with me. I agreed and gave them my address.</p>
<p data-aid="128200366" id="p25">When I got home, I woke my wife and 
told her about the two young men. “What a coincidence,” I said. “One is 
Mexican and the other is American, and they are both named Elder.”</p>
<p data-aid="128200369" id="p26">“Elder means missionary,” my wife answered, knowing just a little about the Church.</p>
<p data-aid="128200371" id="p27">From deep within me, I felt something 
stir. These young men had left a feeling of exquisite wonder in my 
heart. I felt that I was close to finding the water that would quench my
 thirst, that it was within reach.</p>
<p data-aid="128200374" id="p28">The missionaries came to our home on 
5&nbsp;June, and I was happy to listen to them. Two weeks later, on 
19&nbsp;June, I was baptized. My wife was baptized four months later, in
 October [, as was my daughter].</p>
<p data-aid="128200377" id="p29"><span class="page-break" data-page="162"></span>In
 December 1995 we were sealed as a family in the Mexico City Mexico 
Temple for this life and for eternity. Now we are a family enjoying 
harmony, peace, and happiness. We know who we worship. We know where we 
came from and where we are going. We love God’s word, especially the 
Book of Mormon, and we love His Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. Through these gifts we have found that well of living
 water the Savior spoke of to the woman of Samaria: “Whosoever drinketh 
of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water 
that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into 
everlasting life” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4.14?lang=eng#p14">John 4:14</a>).

</header>
<p data-aid="128199540" id="p30">Finding and teaching are related, 
connected activities. When you meet people, be prepared to teach brief 
summaries of restored truth so that the Holy Ghost can bear witness that
 you are the servants of the Lord. In many situations, you will need to 
be able to share a message in a minute or less. People are accustomed to
 short, powerful statements. For example, you may testify of the message
 of the Restoration in just two or three sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199541" id="p31">After centuries of being lost, original
 truths of God (the gospel of Jesus Christ) have been restored by a 
loving God through a living prophet. We have evidence of this that you 
can hold in your hands, read, ponder in your heart, and pray about to 
learn its truth for yourself. Will you allow us to&nbsp;…</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199542" id="p32">If a little more time is available, you might say more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199543" id="p33">Our message is simple. God is our 
Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He loves us. 
From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and 
concern. Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of 
Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him. He has 
revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But some
 people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two thousand years
 ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel. Incredibly, people even 
rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrine and 
ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church.</p>
<p data-aid="128199544" id="p34">Our invitation to you is to add to the 
truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our Heavenly 
Father has again reached out to His children in love and revealed the 
true doctrine and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph
 Smith. The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book 
of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its truth 
in your mind and heart.</p>

<p data-aid="128199545" id="p35"><span class="page-break" data-page="163"></span>Develop
 the habit of beginning to teach and testify as you meet people. You 
will find more people to teach as you testify and allow them to feel the
 power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p data-aid="128199546" id="p36">Whatever your initial approach, refer 
quickly and simply to the Restoration of the gospel, for this is our 
unique message to the world. Those you teach often have friends or 
relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel. In all 
teaching situations—such as finding, teaching people, and working with 
members—ask, “Who do you know who would be interested in and benefit 
from this message?” After receiving a referral, ask, “Who else can 
benefit from our message?” Do not hesitate to bring this up again and 
again in later meetings. As those you teach experience the blessings of 
the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.12?lang=eng#p12">1&nbsp;Nephi 8:12</a>).
 They will often make new friends while learning the gospel. 
Missionaries who apply this principle usually have many people to teach.</p>

<p data-aid="128199554" id="p37">The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ blesses families and individuals. By living the principles of the
 restored gospel, families and individuals are strengthened and can 
experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity.</p>
<p data-aid="128199555" id="p38">Addressing the importance of the family
 with those you meet each day will help you find people to teach. Most 
people have a natural interest in families. In many finding situations, 
you can quickly relate what most people know about the family to the 
message of the Restoration. When finding, you might say something like 
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199556" id="p39">There is nothing more important to us 
than our families. Our family ties us to one another, gives us a name, 
and helps us feel needed and loved. From our families we inherited 
personality traits, attributes, and physical characteristics, giving us 
some unique identity.</p>
<p data-aid="128199557" id="p40">Having a strong, happy family is the 
highest priority for many people throughout the world. Accomplishing 
this goal is often difficult. Raising children and having a strong 
marriage in today’s world can almost seem impossible at times with the 
evils that are all around us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199558" id="p41"><span class="page-break" data-page="164"></span>You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199559" id="p42">The feelings of love and concern that 
we have for our families are eternal and rooted deep within our souls. 
They are centered in our relationship with God. You have been part of 
God’s family since before you were born. He is our Father. Because He is
 our Father, we are brothers and sisters. Heavenly Father wants us to 
return to live with Him as part of His family. Families here on earth 
are a tie to God’s family. Families can live together after this life. 
We know this because after centuries of being lost, true doctrine and 
ordinances such as baptism by immersion have been restored to the earth 
by our loving Heavenly Father through a living prophet. These restored 
truths not only help us understand our place in God’s family, but they 
are the greatest hope we have for a strong, happy family in this life. 
May we teach you more about&nbsp;…</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199560" id="p43">The same thing can be done with other 
topics, such as happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. 
Whatever your finding approach, remember to connect it quickly to our 
unique message to the world.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199561" id="title6">The Importance of Members</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199562" id="p44">Work with members of the Church to find
 people to teach. The ideal situation is when members invite others to 
be taught and are present for the teaching. When members do this, more 
people are baptized and remain active in the Church. Association with 
members is important because it softens people’s hearts and often leads 
them to learn more about the restored gospel. This often means that they
 are brought into the circle of friends of Church members, including 
active and returning members, recent converts, and part-member families.</p>
<aside class="quote" id="aside1">
<p data-aid="128199563" id="aside1_p1">“After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.”</p>
<div class="citation-info">

</div>
</aside>
<p data-aid="128199566" id="p45">President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley 
taught: “So many of us look upon missionary work as simply tracting. 
Everyone who is familiar with this work knows there is a better way. 
That way is through the members of the Church. Whenever there is a 
member who introduces [someone], there is an immediate support system. 
The member bears testimony of the truth of the work. He is anxious for 
the happiness of his … friend. He becomes excited as that friend makes 
progress in learning the gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="128199567" id="p46">“The full-time missionaries may do the 
actual teaching, but the member, wherever possible, will back up that 
teaching with the offering of his home to carry on this missionary 
service. He will bear sincere testimony of the divinity of the work. He 
will be there to answer questions when the missionaries are not around. 
He will be a friend to the convert who is making a big and often 
difficult change. … The process of bringing new people into the Church 
is not the responsibility alone of the missionaries. They succeed best 
when members become the source from which new [people] are found” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p21-22%2C25#p21">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1999, 105–6).</p>
<p data-aid="128199568" id="p47">The starting point in building strong 
relationships with members is the bishop. Offer to help and serve in any
 righteous way that he asks. Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing or
 a burden to the bishop?” Develop a “How can I help?” attitude. If you 
will look for opportunities to love, serve, and teach, the bishop and 
ward members will be more likely to trust you with their family members 
and friends.</p>
<p data-aid="128199569" id="p48"><span class="page-break" data-page="165"></span>Consider the following excerpt from a letter written by a missionary to his mission president:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199570" id="p49">Dear President,</p>
<p data-aid="128199571" id="p50">The assistants called today telling me 
I’m being transferred. I felt that I should write and thank you for 
sending me to this area. It seems like it was just yesterday that you 
were telling me about the challenges that lay ahead.</p>
<p data-aid="128199572" id="p51">Our first Sunday confirmed what you 
told me. We received a lukewarm welcome to the ward. The only ray of 
light that first Sunday was Scott, the new ward mission leader. He had 
been transferred to the Air Force base a month earlier and had been 
serving as ward mission leader for two weeks. Scott invited us to his 
home for dinner our first Sunday to discuss what could be done to get 
the work moving. After dinner, we knelt in prayer and asked Heavenly 
Father for His direction. As we prayed, we felt a sense of peace and 
determination. We determined that the best way to move the work forward 
was to gain the trust of the members. We decided to follow Ammon’s 
example and serve them.</p>
<p data-aid="128199573" id="p52">We started with the bishop. Because of 
the lack of baptisms in the area and the lack of effort from the 
previous missionaries, he was understandably less than excited at our 
request to meet with him. He eventually invited us over to his home for 
dinner. We learned that the bishop was preparing to remove the carpet 
from his living room and restore the hardwood floor found underneath. We
 volunteered our help and he accepted. At the conclusion of the project,
 the bishop asked us to speak in a sacrament meeting. We took this as 
evidence that he was beginning to trust us.</p>
<p data-aid="128199574" id="p53">We followed this same pattern of 
service as we met with other members. We found opportunities to help 
them in a variety of simple ways. When we were not with the members, we 
were knocking on doors and talking to as many people as we could about 
the restored gospel. We were blessed with people to teach, and the 
members saw us bringing people to church whom we were finding on our 
own. The attitude of the whole ward began to change. There was an 
increasing excitement about missionary work. Once the members trusted 
us, the work hastened. Many baptisms followed.</p>

<p data-aid="128199575" id="p54">Many members of the Church have fears 
about doing missionary work. Many are unsure where to begin or what to 
say. Many fear that they will lose close friends if they try to share 
the gospel with them. There are many ways to help the members. For 
example, help build their faith by teaching them the message of the 
Restoration and other doctrine in the lessons. Help them feel the Spirit
 and power of our message. Strengthening their understanding of the 
doctrine of Christ will do more to increase their trust in you and to 
build their excitement to do missionary work than anything else you can 
do. Help them understand that offering the restored gospel will flow 
more naturally out of relationships where they are seeking to love and 
serve their family members and friends. Teach them the principles from 
the “Go About Doing Good” section (see <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/what-is-my-purpose-as-a-missionary?lang=eng&amp;para=title33#title33">chapter 1</a>). Encourage members to “join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who [know] not God” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/6.6?lang=eng#p6">Alma 6:6</a>). In all you do with members, seek to lift and build their faith to help them do missionary work.</p>
<p data-aid="128199576" id="p55">In addition to working with active 
members, seek to find people to teach through part-member families, 
prospective elders, returning members, and new members. These members 
are likely to have many friends of other faiths and be blessed as they 
share the restored gospel with their family members and friends.</p>
<p data-aid="128199577" id="p56"><span class="page-break" data-page="166"></span>In every visit with members, do all you can to encourage them to:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199578" id="p57">Pray and follow the Spirit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199579" id="p58">Give service.</p>
</li>

<p data-aid="128199580" id="p59">Develop friendships.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199583" id="p62">Every referral you receive from a 
member should be treated as something precious. When a member gives you 
the name of a friend to call or visit, respond quickly and report the 
results back to the member. Invite the member to help you teach.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128200508" id="title7">Member, Missionary, and Church Headquarters Referrals</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128200510" id="p63">Referrals are another important 
resource in finding those being prepared for the restored gospel of 
Jesus Christ. Referrals may come from members, other missionaries, or 
Church headquarters. The Church actively reaches out in many ways to 
God’s children through efforts such as media advertising, visitors’ 
centers, historic sites, welfare and humanitarian aid, and the internet.</p>
<p data-aid="137171551" id="p169">When you receive a referral, contact 
the member or missionaries who sent it to you and ask them how you can 
help the person. You may invite the member or missionaries (with their 
mission president’s approval) to participate in teaching the person 
using available technology.</p>
<p data-aid="137171552" id="p170">When you meet someone who is 
interested in learning more but lives outside your assigned area, 
introduce the person to the gospel and help him or her prepare to meet 
members and missionaries where he or she lives. After you send a 
referral, work with the missionaries who received the referral to help 
them begin teaching. With your mission president’s approval, you may 
continue to support and fellowship people you refer to help them receive
 the gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="137171553" id="p171">You can also help members share the 
gospel with people they know. As members prepare and invite their 
friends to meet with missionaries, show members how to send a referral, 
contact the missionaries, and participate in teaching to help ensure the
 person they refer has a good experience.</p>
<p data-aid="137171554" id="p172">Most people who respond to Church 
media campaigns have agreed to have Church representatives visit and 
share more about the gospel. You should view these teaching 
opportunities as a sacred responsibility.</p>
<p data-aid="128200512" id="p64">In some cases, referrals lead you to 
others whom God is preparing. If the people you contact are not 
interested, ask them if they know someone who might be. Talk with other 
members of the household and their neighbors as well. Ask each person 
who else might be interested in your message. Perhaps you have been led 
to this person because someone else in the home or neighborhood is ready
 for the gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="128200513" id="p65">When working with referrals, remember to:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128200529" id="p74">Contact the referring member or 
missionaries to learn more about how to best help the person. The 
referring member or missionaries (with their mission president’s 
approval) may want to counsel with you or assist you through technology 
with the teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200515" id="p66">Attempt to promptly make an initial 
contact with the referred individual through a call, text, email, or 
other communication. Arrange a visit as soon as possible. If the person 
does not respond, leave a message and try again later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200517" id="p67">Arrange a time to meet in person or by means of technology.</p>
</li>
<li>

</header>
<p data-aid="128200536" id="p75">Family history or genealogy provides 
another way you can find people to teach. Family history is now one of 
the most widespread hobbies in the world. What we sometimes refer to as 
the spirit of Elijah is “the distinctive influence of the Holy Ghost 
[that] draws people to identify, document, and cherish their ancestors 
and family members—both past and present” (David&nbsp;A. Bednar, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/10/the-hearts-of-the-children-shall-turn?lang=eng&amp;para=p22#p22">The Hearts of the Children Shall Turn</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> Nov. 2011, 25; see also Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1998/04/a-new-harvest-time?lang=eng&amp;para=p15#p15">A New Harvest Time</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite>
 May 1998, 34). Throughout the world, the Spirit is influencing millions
 of people to search for their ancestors. People can often feel the 
Spirit as they talk about families. Many want a stronger connection with
 their extended family. This can lead to a desire to find a connection 
and identity as part of God’s family. Ancestors eager for their 
ordinances are praying for their posterity on earth to accept your 
teachings and perform those ordinances vicariously for them in the 
temple. </p>
<p data-aid="128199631" id="p76">Determine what types of family history resources are available in your area. For example, you might provide a copy of the <cite>My Family</cite>
 booklet or introduce the people you are teaching to a temple and family
 history consultant or other member who can help them learn about <span class="language" lang="eng">FamilySearch.org</span>. Involve members so that those you are teaching will meet people who can friendship them. Explain that services on <span class="language" lang="eng">FamilySearch.org</span> are offered free of charge.</p>
<p data-aid="128199632" id="p77">For many people, family history is 
about discovering and capturing family stories and photos and recording 
the dates of important life events. You can help those you are teaching 
record this information on <span class="language" lang="eng">FamilySearch.org</span> or in the <cite>My Family</cite> booklet. It is also a good idea to share your own family stories and photos, when appropriate, with those you meet or teach.</p>
<p data-aid="137171556" id="p174">As you invite others to share memories
 of their loved ones, they may feel the Holy Ghost testifying to them 
about the importance of family in God’s plan. These moments can lead to 
natural conversations about the purpose of life, God’s plan of 
happiness, and the role of the Savior in that plan.</p>

<p data-aid="128199644" id="p86">Read the following account related by a senior missionary. Note the role family history played in the couple’s conversion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199645" id="p87">Mildred Schultz was a devout member of 
her church. It was no surprise that when the missionaries knocked on her
 door, she wasted no time in inviting them in so that she could teach 
them the “truth.” As the missionaries taught, she was touched by the 
truths of the restored gospel and was baptized. Throughout the teaching 
process, her husband, Frank, chose not to listen.</p>
<p data-aid="128199646" id="p88">This is where I come into the picture. 
The elders introduced us to Sister Schultz. We helped her begin her 
family tree and then invited her to meet us at the family history 
center. The day came for our meeting, and Frank asked if he might come 
along so that he could search for his ancestors as well. Of course, she 
was thrilled at the prospect, and they headed off to the center.</p>
<p data-aid="128199647" id="p89">The elders had planned to meet us there
 later during the day. Before they arrived, we showed Frank and Mildred 
the library and introduced them to Sister Wright. Sister Wright was the 
family history specialist, and she offered to help find information 
about Frank’s father. She found his name in a book and was also able to 
provide Frank with a map of Germany that showed the location of his 
father’s birth. He was so excited about these discoveries that when the 
elders came, he invited them to dinner to show them pictures and share 
his family history. The Spirit of Elijah had touched and softened his 
heart and had opened a door for the gospel to fill his life.</p>
<p data-aid="128199648" id="p90">That evening, Mildred pondered what she
 might say to help Frank become more interested in the gospel. A 
question came into her mind. “Frank,” she started, “do you want to be 
with me forever, even after this life is over? Do you want to have an 
eternal family?” He quickly said, “Oh, Mildred, of course I do. How can I
 do it?” This question is what she had been praying for. “Listen to what
 the missionaries have to say,” she responded. He agreed. As the elders 
taught, the warmth of the message of the Restoration melted away his 
doubts and fears. He readily accepted the truths the missionaries 
shared. He accepted the invitation to be baptized. Frank and Mildred 
have been strong and active in the Church ever since.</p>
<p data-aid="128199649" id="p91">Frank and Mildred worked hard to 
complete the work so that the saving ordinances could be performed for 
their family. It was an exciting day when they were baptized in behalf 
of their family members. In the process of getting the temple work done,
 Brother Schultz had a dream about his father. He saw his father at the 
ranch that served as his childhood home. His father was standing beside 
his porch rocker, dressed in white and holding his arms out to his son. 
Frank awoke from the dream crying. He knew that his father had accepted 
the work they had done.</p>

why we do family history work. In addition, convert retention is 
enhanced as new members are able to search their family roots and 
perform sacred ordinances in behalf of their ancestors.</p>

<p data-aid="128199666" id="p93">People who have been taught previously 
are a valuable source for finding people to teach. There are many 
reasons why people stop meeting with missionaries. Reasons include 
missionaries being transferred, people going on vacation, missionaries 
stopping visits even though people are still expecting visits, and 
people believing that the missionaries have nothing new to teach them. 
Many people who have been taught previously say they would meet with 
missionaries again.</p>
<p data-aid="128199667" id="p94">Review your area book often to identify
 people who have been taught previously. Prayerfully reflect on the 
information in the area book concerning how each person first came in 
contact with the Church, what they have been taught, how they have 
responded, and why they stopped receiving the lessons. If members have 
been involved in teaching and fellowshipping these people, ask the 
members what they remember about the experience. Based on this 
information, make plans to contact the person again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199670" id="p97">Much to my surprise, I was called to 
labor in the same mission where my older sister had served a year 
earlier. After a few months in the mission field, I was transferred to 
one of the areas where my sister had served. Upon learning of my 
transfer, my sister wrote and asked me to visit a family that she and 
her companion had taught. She expressed the love and closeness she had 
with the Norman family and how disappointed she was when they 
discontinued investigating the Church.</p>
<p data-aid="128199671" id="p98">My companion and I located the Normans 
and were warmly received by them. They accepted our invitation to again 
hear the restored gospel. I’m not sure what the difference was this 
time, but they were fully ready to accept our message. The entire family
 was baptized and confirmed.</p>
<p data-aid="128199672" id="p99">After this experience, I wondered about
 other [people] my sister had worked with. I thought, “If it worked for 
the Normans, maybe it will work for other people she taught as well.” I 
decided to write my sister about the idea of contacting other people she
 had taught. She went through her journal and sent me the names of other
 [people] in the area.</p>
<p data-aid="128199673" id="p100">My companion and I spent the next week
 contacting these people. To our delight, almost half of them accepted 
an invitation to hear the restored gospel again. Several of this group 
were baptized and confirmed. While meeting with these [people], we also 
asked them for referrals of their friends and acquaintances that would 
be interested in our message. As a result, we found additional people to
 teach. This was the busiest time of my mission.</p>

<p data-aid="128200672" id="p133">When people choose not to learn more 
about the restored gospel, your work is not wasted. Your consistent 
efforts in serving and teaching as many people as you can are one way 
God prepares His children to eventually receive His servants. He often 
reaches out to His children through you. Even when people do not accept 
the opportunity to learn the gospel, your service and words are evidence
 of God’s love for them and may plant seeds that future missionaries and
 members of the Church will harvest.</p>
<p data-aid="128200673" id="p134">When people do not accept the gospel, 
do not be discouraged. You have raised a warning voice. You have given 
them a clear choice. Disciples of Christ feel sorrow when people choose 
not to repent, but they maintain a vision of who they are and what they 
are doing. They continue to diligently move forward.</p>

<li>
<p data-aid="128200686" id="p135">Read the following letter from a 
missionary to her parents: “I taught a wonderful lady on the bus. We 
were coming back from district [council], and it was the only empty seat
 so I sat down and started to look at my mail. Of course, the first one 
to be read was yours, with the baby pictures of Evan. I noticed that the
 eyes next to me were also looking at the pictures, and I looked over to
 meet eyes with an older woman. She gave me a half smile and looked out 
the window. She then closed her eyes like she was going to sleep. I 
prayed, ‘Heavenly Father, I want to talk to her. Please help me.’ A 
minute later she opened her eyes and sat up straight, and I quickly 
said, ‘Don’t you think he is cute?’ I showed her the pictures of baby 
Evan and started talking about families with her. I asked her about her 
kids, and she got teary-eyed and told me a story about how her daughter 
hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She cried and I cried with 
her. I told her about the plan of salvation and how Heavenly Father 
knows her and knows what she is going through. I cried and told her that
 I know that her daughter loves her because I am a daughter of a mother 
that loves me, and I love her. I explained that sometimes people make 
bad decisions and that her daughter has agency. She told me, smiling, ‘I
 bet your mother really misses you, and she will not let you go when she
 sees you again.’ She thanked me for talking with her and gave me her 
address so that we can share the gospel with her. As she was getting off
 the bus, she said, ‘I got on the wrong bus, but I didn’t get off. No 
one sat by me until you came … and look what happened.’ God’s plan is 
perfect!”</p>

<p data-aid="128200692" id="p140">Using your daily planner, make plans 
to meet with recent converts. Ask them to share how they were prepared 
for the gospel. Ask questions like these: When did you first come in 
contact with the Church? What prompted you to meet with missionaries? 
Write what you learn in your study journal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200693" id="p141">Review each of the following topics.
