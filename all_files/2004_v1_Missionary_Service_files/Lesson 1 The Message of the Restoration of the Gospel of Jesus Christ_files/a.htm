 Father has provided us, His children, with a way to be successful in 
this life and to return to live in His presence. However, we must be 
pure and clean through obedience in order to do so. Disobedience moves 
us away from Him. Central to our Father’s plan is Jesus Christ’s 
Atonement. Jesus Christ’s Atonement included His suffering in the Garden
 of Gethsemane as well as His suffering and death on the cross. Through 
Christ’s Atonement we can be freed from the burden of our sins and 
develop faith and strength to face our trials.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128202904" id="p4">The restored gospel of Jesus Christ 
blesses individuals and families. It helps husbands and wives, parents 
and children as they strive to develop stronger relationships and 
spiritual strength in their families. These blessings are available now 
and in eternity. The gospel of Jesus Christ provides help with current 
concerns and challenges.</p>
<p data-aid="128202906" id="p5">The message of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ is that all individuals are part of God’s family and that 
families can be united now and in eternity. Because families are 
ordained of God, they are the most important social unit in time and in 
eternity. God has established families to bring happiness to His 
children, allow them to learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere,
 and prepare them for eternal life. The home is the best place to teach,
 learn, and apply principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. A home 
established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety. 
It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide, blessing 
family members with peace, joy, and happiness. Through prophets in every
 age, including our own, God has revealed His plan of happiness for 
individuals and families.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128202908" id="title4">Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128202910" id="p6">One important way that God shows His 
love for us is by calling prophets, who are given the priesthood—the 
power and authority given to man to act in God’s name for the salvation 
of His children. Prophets learn the gospel of Jesus Christ by 
revelation. They in <span class="page-break" data-page="33"></span>turn 
teach the gospel to others and testify of Jesus Christ as the Savior and
 Redeemer. The teachings of prophets are found in sacred books called 
scriptures.</p>
<p data-aid="128202912" id="p7">Our Father’s plan for us to be 
successful in this life and to return to live with Him is called the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, with Jesus’s Atonement at the center of that 
plan. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can receive eternal life
 if we exercise faith in Jesus Christ, repent, are baptized by immersion
 for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and 
endure to the end. “This is the way; and there is none other way nor 
name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. 
And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.21?lang=eng#p21">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:21</a>).
 All people have the gift of agency, which includes the freedom to 
accept or reject the gospel as taught by the prophets and apostles. 
Those who choose to obey are blessed, but those who ignore, reject, or 
distort the gospel do not receive God’s promised blessings.</p>
<p data-aid="128202914" id="p8">Whenever people choose to disregard, 
disobey, or distort any gospel principle or ordinance, whenever they 
reject the Lord’s prophets, or whenever they fail to endure in faith, 
they distance themselves from God and begin to live in spiritual 
darkness. Eventually this leads to a condition called apostasy. When 
widespread apostasy occurs, God withdraws His priesthood authority to 
teach and administer the ordinances of the gospel.</p>

<p data-aid="128202916" id="p9">Biblical history has recorded many 
instances of God speaking to prophets, and it also tells of many 
instances of apostasy. To end each period of general apostasy, God has 
shown His love for His children by calling another prophet and giving 
him priesthood authority to restore and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ
 anew. In essence, the prophet acts as a steward to oversee the 
household of God here on earth. Such periods of time headed by prophetic
 responsibility are called dispensations.</p>
<p data-aid="128202918" id="p10">God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ
 to Adam and gave him priesthood authority. Adam was the first prophet 
on the earth. By revelation, Adam learned of mankind’s proper 
relationship with God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy 
Ghost; of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ; and of the 
first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Adam and Eve taught their
 children these truths and encouraged them to develop faith and to live 
the gospel in all aspects of their lives. Adam was followed by other 
prophets, but over time the posterity of Adam rejected the gospel and 
fell into apostasy, choosing to be unrighteous.</p>
<p data-aid="128202920" id="p11">Thus began the pattern of prophetic 
dispensations that makes up much of the recorded history of the Old 
Testament. Heavenly Father revealed His gospel through direct 
communication to prophets such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Each prophet
 was called by God to begin a new dispensation of the gospel. To each of
 these prophets God granted priesthood authority and revealed eternal 
truths. Unfortunately, in each dispensation people eventually used their
 agency to choose to reject the gospel and then fell into apostasy.</p>

<p class="title" data-aid="128202922" id="figure5_title1"><span class="page-break" data-page="34"></span>Prophets</p>
</header>
<p data-aid="128202924" id="figure5_p1">Determine what the person you 
are teaching understands about prophets. In most cultures there are 
people who believe that holy or inspired people receive some form of 
guidance and direction from Deity. However, not all inspired individuals
 are prophets of God as defined in the restored gospel. Explain clearly 
that God establishes His kingdom on the earth by calling a prophet to 
establish a new dispensation. He gives that prophet priesthood 
authority. The prophet then helps people understand their relationship 
to Deity, including how to receive eternal life through the gospel of 
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="128202926" id="figure5_p2">You might wonder how gospel 
dispensations are relevant when teaching people who do not have a 
Christian background or culture. But you will find that by briefly 
relating the history of gospel dispensations, you can help people 
understand that God loves His children and that He is the same 
yesterday, today, and forever.</p>

<p data-aid="128202952" id="p12">A few hundred years before the birth of
 Jesus Christ, people again fell into apostasy. But when the Savior 
began His mortal ministry He established His Church again on the earth.</p>
<p data-aid="128202954" id="p13">Heavenly Father sent His Son to the 
earth to atone for the sins of all mankind and overcome death: “For God

 Our Heavenly Father sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take upon Him, by 
His suffering, the sins of all who would live on this earth and to 
overcome physical death. The Savior made an infinite atoning sacrifice 
so that if we have faith in Him, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy 
Ghost, and endure to the end, we can receive forgiveness of our sins and
 enter and follow the path that will lead us to eternal life in God’s 
presence (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13-21?lang=eng#p13">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:13–21</a>).</p>

<h2 data-aid="128202972" id="title6">The Great Apostasy</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128202974" id="p16">After the death of Jesus Christ, wicked
 people persecuted the Apostles and Church members and killed many of 
them. With the death of the Apostles, priesthood keys and the presiding 
priesthood authority were taken from the earth. The Apostles had kept 
the doctrine of the gospel pure and maintained the order and standard of
 worthiness for Church members. Without the Apostles, over time the 
doctrine was corrupted, and unauthorized changes were made in Church 
organization and priesthood ordinances, such as baptism and conferring 
the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p data-aid="128202976" id="p17">Without revelation and priesthood 
authority, people relied on human wisdom to interpret the scriptures and
 the principles and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. False 
ideas were taught as truth. Much of the knowledge of the true character 
and nature of God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost 
was lost. Important parts of the doctrine of faith in Jesus Christ, 
repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost became distorted or 
forgotten. The priesthood authority given to Christ’s Apostles was no 
longer present on the earth. This apostasy eventually led to the 
emergence of many churches.</p>
<p data-aid="128202978" id="p18">After centuries of spiritual darkness, 
truth-seeking men and women protested against current religious 
practices. They recognized that much of the doctrine and many of the 
ordinances of the gospel had been changed or lost. They sought for 
greater spiritual light, and many spoke of the need for a restoration of
 truth. None of these people claimed, however, that God had called them 
to be a prophet. Instead, they tried to reform teachings and practices 
that they believed had been changed or corrupted. Their efforts led to 
the organization of many Protestant churches. This Reformation resulted 
in an increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for 
the final Restoration.</p>
<p data-aid="128202980" id="p19">The Savior’s Apostles foretold this 
universal apostasy. They also foretold that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
and His Church would be restored once more upon the earth.</p>

<p data-aid="128203025" id="figure9_p1">As you teach, help people 
understand that a universal apostasy occurred following the death of 
Jesus Christ and His Apostles. If there had been no apostasy, there 
would have been no need of a Restoration. As a diamond displayed on 
black velvet appears more brilliant, so the Restoration stands in 
striking contrast to the dark background of the Great Apostasy. As 
guided by the Spirit, teach people about the Great Apostasy at a level 
of detail appropriate to their needs and circumstances. Your purpose is 
to help them understand the need for the Restoration of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="title" data-aid="128203027" id="figure9_title2">Key Points</p>
</header>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128203029" id="figure9_p2">The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19-20?lang=eng#p19">Ephesians 2:19–20</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4.11-14?lang=eng#p11">4:11–14</a>).
 These leaders have divine priesthood authority. Through revelation they
 direct the affairs of the Church. They maintain doctrinal purity, 
authorize the administration of ordinances, and call and confer the 
priesthood authority upon others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203031" id="figure9_p3">People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24.9?lang=eng#p9">Matthew 24:9</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.32-34?lang=eng#p32">1&nbsp;Nephi 11:32–34</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.5?lang=eng#p5">2&nbsp;Nephi 27:5</a>).
 With the death of the Apostles, the presiding priesthood authority was 
absent from the Church. Consequently, there was no longer authority to 
confer the Holy Ghost or perform other saving ordinances. Revelation 
ceased, and doctrine became corrupted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203033" id="figure9_p4">Even before the death of the 
Apostles, many conflicts concerning doctrine arose. The Roman Empire, 
which at first had persecuted the Christians, later adopted 
Christianity. Important religious questions were settled by councils. 
The simple doctrine and ordinances taught by the Savior were debated and
 changed to conform to worldly philosophies (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/24.5?lang=eng#p5">Isaiah 24:5</a>). They physically changed the scriptures, removing plain and precious doctrine from them (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.26-40?lang=eng#p26">1&nbsp;Nephi 13:26–40</a>). They created creeds, or statements of belief, based on false and changed doctrine (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng#p19">Joseph Smith—History 1:19</a>). Because of pride, some aspired to positions of influence (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/3-jn/1.9-10?lang=eng#p9">3&nbsp;John 1:9–10</a>).
 People accepted these false ideas and gave honor to false teachers who 
taught pleasing doctrines rather than divine truth (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.3-4?lang=eng#p3">2&nbsp;Timothy 4:3–4</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203035" id="figure9_p5">Throughout history, many people 
have sincerely believed false creeds and doctrines. They have worshipped
 according to the light they possessed and have received answers to 
their prayers. Yet they are “kept from the truth because they know not 
where to find it” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.12?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 123:12</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203037" id="figure9_p6">Therefore, a restoration, not a 
reformation, was required. Priesthood authority did not continue in an 
unbroken line of succession from the Apostle Peter. To reform is to 
change what already exists; to restore is to bring back something in its
 original form. Thus, restoration of priesthood authority through divine
 messengers was the only possible way to overcome the Great Apostasy.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128203039" id="title7">The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128203041" id="p20">When the circumstances were right, 
Heavenly Father once again reached out to His children in love. He 
called a young man named Joseph Smith as a prophet. Through him the 
fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth.</p>
<p data-aid="128203043" id="p21">Joseph Smith lived in the United 
States, which was perhaps the only country to enjoy religious freedom at
 the time. It was at a time of great religious excitement in the eastern
 United States. His family members were deeply religious and constantly 
sought for truth. But many ministers claimed to have the true gospel. 
Joseph desired “to know which of all the sects was right” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.18?lang=eng#p18">Joseph Smith—History 1:18</a>). The Bible taught there was “one Lord, one faith, one baptism” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4.5?lang=eng#p5">Ephesians 4:5</a>). Joseph attended different churches, but he remained confused about which church he should join. He later wrote:</p>
<p data-aid="128203045" id="p22"><span class="page-break" data-page="37"></span>“So
 great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, 
that it was impossible for a person young as I was … to come to any 
certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. … In the midst of 
this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What 
is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all 
wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I
 know it?” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.8,10?lang=eng#p8">Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128203047" id="p23">As Joseph sought truth among the 
different faiths, he turned to the Bible for guidance. He read, “If any 
of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men 
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/1.5?lang=eng#p5">James 1:5</a>).
 Because of this passage, Joseph decided to ask God what he should do. 
In the spring of 1820 he went to a nearby grove of trees and knelt in 
prayer. We have four different accounts of what followed, recorded by 
him or scribes under his direction (see Gospel Topics essay, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/first-vision-accounts?lang=eng">First Vision Accounts</a>”). In one account, he described his experience:</p>
<p data-aid="128203050" id="p24">“I saw a pillar of light exactly over 
my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually 
until it fell upon me. … When the light rested upon me I saw two 
Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing 
above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and 
said, pointing to the other—<em>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</em>” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.16-17?lang=eng#p16">Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="128203052" id="p25">In this vision God the Father and His 
Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith. The Savior told Joseph not 
to join any of the churches, for they “were all wrong” and “all their 
creeds were an abomination.” He stated, “They draw near to me with their
 lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the 
commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power
 thereof” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng#p19">Joseph Smith—History 1:19</a>).
 Even though many good people believed in Christ and tried to understand
 and teach His gospel, they did not have the fulness of truth or the 
priesthood authority to baptize and perform other saving ordinances. 
They had inherited a state of apostasy as each generation was influenced
 by what the previous one passed on, including changes in the doctrine 
and in ordinances such as baptism. As God had done with Adam, Noah, 
Abraham, Moses, and other prophets, He called Joseph Smith to be a 
prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel was restored to the 
earth.</p>
<p data-aid="128203055" id="p26">After the appearance of the Father and 
the Son, other heavenly messengers, or angels, were sent to Joseph Smith
 and his associate Oliver Cowdery. John the Baptist appeared and 
conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, 
which includes the authority to perform the ordinance of baptism. Peter,
 James, and John (three of Christ’s original Apostles) appeared and 
conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery, restoring the same authority given to Christ’s Apostles 
anciently. With this priesthood authority, Joseph Smith was directed to 
organize the Church of Jesus Christ again on the earth. Through him, 
Jesus Christ called twelve Apostles.</p>
<p data-aid="128203058" id="p27"><span class="page-break" data-page="38"></span>The
 time in which we live is referred to by Bible prophets as the last 
days, the latter days, or the dispensation of the fulness of times. It 
is the period of time just before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. It

</header>
<p data-aid="128203096" id="p29">Knowing that doubt, disbelief, and 
misinformation would remain after centuries of darkness, our loving 
Heavenly Father brought forth an ancient volume of holy scripture 
comparable to the Bible, which contains the fulness of the everlasting 
gospel of Jesus Christ. This volume of holy scripture provides 
convincing evidence that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God. This 
record is the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="128203099" id="p30">Joseph Smith was directed by a heavenly
 messenger named Moroni to a hill where golden plates had lain hidden 
for centuries. These golden plates contained the writings of prophets 
giving an account of God’s dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants
 of the Americas. Joseph Smith translated the contents of these plates 
by the power of God. The prophets in the Book of Mormon knew about the 
mission of the Savior and taught His gospel. After His Resurrection, 
Christ appeared to these people. He taught them His gospel and 
established His Church. The Book of Mormon proves that “God does inspire
 men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well 
as in generations of old” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.11?lang=eng#p11">Doctrine and Covenants 20:11</a>).
 In order to know that the Book of Mormon is true, a person must read it
 and ponder and pray about it. The honest seeker of truth will soon come
 to feel that the Book of Mormon is the word of God.</p>
<p data-aid="128203102" id="p31">Reading, pondering, and praying about 
the Book of Mormon are critical for an enduring conversion. Those who 
begin reading the Book of Mormon for the first time take important steps
 toward coming to know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that 
the true Church has been restored to the earth.</p>

<p data-aid="128203107" id="figure13_p1">Following is an example of what you might say when introducing the Book of Mormon:</p>
<p data-aid="128203110" id="figure13_p2">“God loves His children, so He 
provided a convincing way to confirm the truth of what we have said. It 
is the Book of Mormon. Would you please read the last two paragraphs in 
the introduction to the book?”</p>
<p data-aid="128203113" id="figure13_p3">Carefully explain the meaning 
of each concept in both paragraphs and invite those you teach to read 
portions of the Book of Mormon and to apply the principles described in 
these two paragraphs.</p>
<p data-aid="128203115" id="figure13_p4">When introducing a person to 
the Book of Mormon, it is helpful to show him or her a copy, briefly 
review the contents, and share one or two passages that are personally

<p data-aid="128203137" id="p32">This message of the Restoration of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ is either true or it is not. We can know that it 
is true by the power of the Holy Ghost, as promised in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng#p3">Moroni 10:3–5</a>.
 Consistent study of the scriptures (particularly the Book of Mormon), 
regular church attendance, and sincere prayer help us feel the power of 
the Holy Ghost and discover truth. After reading and pondering the 
message of the Book of Mormon, any who desire to know the truth must ask
 our Heavenly Father in prayer in the name of Jesus Christ if it is 
true.</p>
<p data-aid="137171666" id="p62">Because God is our Father and we are 
His children, He will help us recognize truth. When we pray with faith, 
sincerity, and real intent—a commitment to act on the answers we 
receive—God will answer our questions, guide our lives, and help us make
 good decisions.</p>
<p data-aid="137171667" id="p63">When we pray, we address our Heavenly 
Father. We thank Him for our blessings and ask to know that the message 
of the Book of Mormon is true. No one can know of spiritual truths 
without prayer.</p>
<p data-aid="128203151" id="p33">In answer to our prayers, the Holy 
Ghost will teach us truth through our feelings and thoughts. Feelings 
that come from the Holy Ghost are powerful, but they are also usually 
gentle and quiet. As we begin to feel that what we are learning is true,
 we will desire to know all that we can about the Restoration.</p>
<p data-aid="128203154" id="p34">Knowing that the Book of Mormon is true
 leads to a knowledge that Joseph Smith was called as a prophet and that
 the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him.</p>

<p data-aid="128203159" id="figure15_p1">Although prayer has a role in 
many religions and cultures, it is rarely considered to be a two-way 
communication between God and man. Help those you teach understand that 
they can speak the feelings of their hearts in prayer. Demonstrate this 
in the way you pray when beginning or ending a lesson. Use simple 
language that they can also use when they pray. Help them understand 
that our Heavenly Father will answer their prayers, typically through 
the feelings of their hearts and thoughts in their minds. If they are 
sincere and really want to know whether God is there, He will answer 
them. Invite the head of the household to offer a kneeling prayer at the
 end of the lesson.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128203238" id="figure19_p1">Our message is remarkable and 
simple. God is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His 
family. He loves us. From the beginning of the world, He has followed a 
pattern of love and concern. Many times He has reached out in love to 
reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to 
return to Him. He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, 
and Moses. But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel. Two 
thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel and 
established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement. Incredibly, 
people even rejected Jesus. Whenever people disregard or distort true 
doctrine and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the 
Church.</p>
<p data-aid="128203241" id="figure19_p2">Our invitation to you and all 
people is to add to the truths you already treasure. Consider our 
evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again 
reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the 
gospel to a prophet. This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith. The evidence 
of this glorious truth is found in a book—the <span class="page-break" data-page="42"></span>Book
 of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about. If you pray with a
 sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you 
by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true.</p>

<h3 data-aid="128203393" id="title12"><span class="page-break" data-page="44"></span>Key Definitions</h3>
</header>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128203396" id="p40"><strong>Agency:</strong> The ability and privilege God gives people to choose and to act for themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203398" id="p41"><strong>Apostasy:</strong> A turning 
away from the truth by individuals, the Church, or entire nations. It 
includes rebellion against authority and rejection of prophets. Evidence
 of apostasy includes transgressing God’s laws, changing gospel 
ordinances, and breaking covenants (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/24.5?lang=eng#p5">Isaiah 24:5</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203400" id="p42"><strong>Dispensation:</strong> A period
 of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the 
earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood. In addition to Jesus 
Christ, prophets such as Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Joseph 
Smith have each started a new gospel dispensation. When the Lord 
organizes a dispensation, the gospel is revealed anew so that the people
 of that dispensation do not have to depend on past dispensations for 
knowledge of the plan of salvation. The dispensation begun by Joseph 
Smith is known as the “dispensation of the fulness of times.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203403" id="p43"><strong>Priesthood:</strong> The authority and power that God gives to man to act in the name of Jesus Christ in all things for the salvation of mankind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203406" id="p44"><strong>Prophet:</strong> A man who has
 been called by and speaks for God. As a messenger of God, a prophet 
receives priesthood authority, commandments, prophecies, and revelations
 from God. His responsibility is to make known God’s will and true 
character to mankind and to show the meaning of His dealings with them. A
 prophet denounces sin and foretells its consequences. He is a preacher 
of righteousness. On occasion, a prophet may be inspired to foretell the
 future for the benefit of mankind. His primary responsibility, however,
 is to bear witness of Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203408" id="p45"><strong>Redeemer:</strong> Jesus Christ
 is the great Redeemer of mankind because He, through His Atonement, 
paid the price for the sins of mankind and made possible the 
Resurrection of all people. To redeem is to deliver, to purchase, or to 
ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment. Redemption 
refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin. 
Jesus’s Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death. Through His 
Atonement, which includes His suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross 
as well as His Resurrection, those who have faith in Him and who repent 
are redeemed from spiritual death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203411" id="p46"><strong>Reformer:</strong> To reform is to make changes to something in order to improve it. The term <i>reformers</i> refers to those men and women (such as <a href="#figure21_p3">Martin Luther</a>, <a href="#figure21_p5">William Tyndale</a>, and <a href="#figure21_p1">John Wycliffe</a>) who protested the practices of the existing church, which they felt needed to be reformed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203414" id="p47"><strong>Restoration:</strong> To 
restore means to return to a former condition, or to bring back. The 
Restoration, as used by Latter-day Saints, means that the true Church of
 Jesus Christ, which was lost through apostasy, was brought back as it 
originally existed when organized by Jesus Christ. Unlike the 
Reformation, the Restoration was accomplished by divine authority 
through revelation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203416" id="p48"><strong>Revelation:</strong> 
Communication from God to His children on earth. Revelation may come 
through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost by way of inspiration, 
visions, dreams, or visits by angels. Revelation provides guidance that 
can lead the faithful to eternal salvation in the celestial kingdom. The
 Lord reveals His work to His prophets and confirms to believers that 
the revelations to the prophets are true (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7?lang=eng#p7">Amos 3:7</a>).
 Through revelation, the Lord provides individual guidance for every 
person who seeks it and who has faith, repents, and is obedient to the 
gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, including the practice of having
 people pay money to be forgiven of their sins. He was the founder of 
Lutheranism. Died 18&nbsp;February 1546.</p>
</dd>
<dt data-aid="136219198" id="figure21_p5">William Tyndale:</dt>

<p data-aid="128203482" id="figure21_p10">Just as the Western Christian 
world was blessed by the courage and vision of the reformers, many other
 nations and cultures have been blessed by those who were given that 
portion of light and truth “that [God] seeth fit that they should have” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.8?lang=eng#p8">Alma 29:8</a>).

around him. Fled from his father’s luxurious palace, renounced the 
world, and lived in poverty. Seeking enlightenment, he discovered what 
he called the “path of deliverance” and Nirvana, liberation from a cycle
 of painful or less meaningful existence. Became a teacher for a 
community of monks.</p>

meditated on Mount Hira. Said the angel Gabriel appeared to him and 
delivered communications from Allah (God) from 610 to his death in 632. 
These communications, which he recited to his disciples, were later 
written in the Koran, or Qur’an, the sacred book of Islam. General 
Muslim practices include faith, prayer, giving to the poor and needy, 
fasting, and holy pilgrimage.</p>

was one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars of the 
Middle Ages. He is also known for his influence on some of the most 
influential Christian writers, such as Saint Thomas Aquinas. He died on 
12 December 1204.</p>

 Roman Catholic friar, deacon, and preacher who founded several 
religious orders, including one that still takes care of many Christian 
sacred sites in the Holy Land. St. Francis is one of the most admired 
religious figures in history. He believed that nature itself was the 
mirror of God and called all creatures his “brothers” and “sisters.” One
 of his poems is the basis of a popular hymn, “All Creatures of Our God 
and King.” He died on 3 October 1226.</p>
