</header>
<p data-aid="128201018" id="p4">Perhaps you have wondered which of your 
many duties are the most important. To be able to answer this question, 
you must understand your purpose and know how effective use of time can 
help you fulfill this purpose.</p>
<p data-aid="128201019" id="p5">Your purpose is to invite others to come
 unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith 
in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. Key indicators have 
been identified by Church leaders to help you focus on this purpose. As 
you focus on these indicators, you will help people progress toward 
baptism, confirmation, continued activity in the Church, and lasting 
conversion.</p>
<figure class="for-teacher" data-purpose="doctrine-insight" id="figure3">
<header>
<p class="title" data-aid="128201020" id="figure3_title1">Key Indicators to Record and Report</p>
</header>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128201021" id="figure3_p1">People baptized and confirmed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201024" id="figure3_p2">People with a baptismal date</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201026" id="figure3_p3">People who attended sacrament meeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201029" id="figure3_p4">New people being taught</p>
</li>
</ul>
</figure>
<p data-aid="128201043" id="p6">These indicators identify events and 
conditions that show a person’s progress toward enduring conversion. A 
brief description of each key indicator is given below.</p>
<p data-aid="128201046" id="p7"><strong>People baptized and confirmed:</strong> Each convert who has received the ordinances of baptism and confirmation.</p>
<p data-aid="128201048" id="p8"><strong>People with a baptismal date:</strong> Each person who has agreed to be baptized and confirmed on specific dates.</p>
<p data-aid="128201051" id="p9"><strong>People who attended sacrament meeting:</strong> Each person (not baptized) you are teaching who has attended sacrament meeting.</p>
<p data-aid="128201065" id="p15"><strong>New people being taught:</strong>
 The total number of people (not baptized) who have received a lesson 
and accepted a specific return appointment. A lesson typically includes a
 prayer (when appropriate), the teaching of at least one gospel 
principle or topic, and extending appropriate invitations.</p>
<p data-aid="128201070" id="p17">As you set goals and make plans, 
evaluate what you do in terms of how your efforts will add to the 
numbers of people represented in each of these key indicators. Your goal
 should be to have increasing numbers for every key indicator.</p>
<p data-aid="128201073" id="p18">You will do many things that are not 
described in the key indicators, such as street contacting or personal 
and companion study. These important activities contribute to one or 
more of the key indicators. For example, when you teach those you find 
through your own efforts, you add new people to your teaching pool. 
Also, the quality of your personal and companion study will improve your
 ability to teach by the Spirit, blessing the people you are teaching. 
The power of your finding and teaching will influence every key 
indicator. Evaluate all you do based on whether it adds to the numbers 
of people in these categories. If you and your companion cannot see how a
 missionary activity might help increase the numbers of people in one or
 more key indicators, you need to question whether the activity is worth
 your time.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201078" id="figure4_p1">In your study journal, list 
every missionary activity you have done in the past three days. For each
 activity, determine if it influenced one of the key indicators. If it 
did, write <i>yes</i> beside it. If it did not, write <i>no.</i> For each activity with a <i>yes,</i> describe how it had an impact. For each activity with a <i>no,</i>
 decide why you did it and whether you will continue to do the activity 
in the future. Discuss your list with your companion, and explain why 
you marked some activities <i>yes</i> and some activities <i>no.</i> Discuss which activities you may need to stop doing.</p>

may also set goals for your personal development. Do everything within 
your power to achieve your goals while respecting the agency of others. 
The ultimate measure of success is not in achieving goals alone but in 
the service you render and the progress of others. Goals are a means of 
helping you bring about much good among Heavenly Father’s children. They
 are not to be used to receive recognition.</p>
<aside class="quote" id="aside1">
<p data-aid="128202192" id="aside1_p1">“I am so thoroughly convinced 
that if we don’t set goals in our life and learn how to master the 
techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and
 look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of 
our full potential. When one learns to master the principles of setting a
 goal, he will then be able to make a great difference in the results he
 attains in this life.”</p>

</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202202" id="p82">Measure your progress each day, each 
week, and each month. When you fall short of a goal, evaluate your

<p data-aid="128202203" id="p83">Over time your mission president may

<h2 data-aid="128202212" id="title5">The Weekly Planning Session</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128202213" id="p84">Once you have set goals, decide how you
 will achieve them. You and your companion should hold a weekly planning
 session on a day and at a time that is less productive for sharing the 
gospel. Your mission president will set the day and time of the weekly 
planning session. This weekly planning should not take more than two to 
three hours to complete.</p>
<p data-aid="128202214" id="p85">Your discussion should focus on the 
needs of people and how to help them progress. During this weekly 
planning session, review past goals and set new goals for the coming 
week and month. Consider every aspect of your missionary work.</p>
<p data-aid="128202215" id="p86">Sunday evening is the recommended time 
for completing the Weekly and Monthly Key Indicator Report. If you do 
not report key indicators automatically or through the Missionary 
Portal, then a Sunday-evening report provides the most accurate and 
timely status of the mission because most baptisms and confirmations 
take place on Saturday or Sunday.</p>
<p data-aid="128202216" id="p87">Because the day you hold your weekly 
planning session is likely to be different from your reporting day, 
approach your weekly planning with 10 days in mind. For example, if your
 weekly planning session is on Thursday, you will review the progress on
 your goals so far that week, and you will plan what you need to do to 
achieve these goals through Sunday. Then, set goals and make plans for 
the next week from Monday to Sunday. On Sunday evening you will total 
and report the results from the past week, and you will have your plan 
ready for the coming week. Below is a description of how the planning 
guidelines apply to a weekly planning session. As you use these 
guidelines, notice that you will follow a pattern of first setting goals
 and then making plans to achieve them. The plans you make should 
identify the specific steps you need to take to reach your goals.</p>

 Before you begin, have your planning tools near, such as the Missionary
 Daily Planner and area book or digital tools. Begin your planning 
session with prayer. Seek inspiration as you discuss the needs of people
 and plan how to serve them and help them progress in the gospel. Pray 
specifically for those you are teaching. Have the faith to ask Heavenly 
Father to bless them with answers to their prayers, with a desire to 
attend church, and so forth.</p>

need to make for baptismal interviews, services, and confirmations. 
Using the Teaching Record, discuss any commitments these people may be 
struggling with and how you can help them. Plan to make daily contact

you can help them prepare for baptism and confirmation. Discuss why 
someone might not have been baptized on their scheduled day. Carefully 
consider and discuss their needs. Set new goals and make plans that will
 help them progress toward a specific day and time when they can enter 
into the covenant of baptism and receive the ordinance of confirmation. 
On your Teaching Record, record the principles you plan to teach and the
 commitments you will help them keep. Determine what you can do to help 
them receive these lessons and keep these commitments.</p>

<p data-aid="128202220" id="p91"><strong>Set goals and make plans to help people attend sacrament meeting.</strong>
 Review the Teaching Record for each person, and discuss his or her 
attendance at sacrament meeting. For people who are attending sacrament 
meeting regularly, discuss what you need to do to help them continue to 
have a spiritually uplifting experience. For those who have never 
attended sacrament meeting, who have attended only once, or who attend 
occasionally, discuss what might be keeping them from coming. For 
example, they might need help with transportation, they may be afraid or
 unfamiliar with Church services, or they may have had a negative 
experience in the past. Discuss what you can do to help them overcome 
these barriers. Set goals for the number of people you plan to have in 
the next sacrament meeting. Plan who will take these people to church, 
who will greet them, and who will sit with them during meetings. Plan to
 contact quorum and auxiliary leaders and any teachers responsible for 
the classes the visitors will attend. Plan to inform the bishop. On the

 week—preferably all the referrals. Referrals should be contacted within
 24 hours, if at all possible. Contact the person who submitted the 
referral to learn more and to plan how you might work together with 
them. Discuss how you might approach each person or family and what 
message you might teach. If the referral is from Church headquarters, 
discuss how you will teach a gospel message using the video, book, or 
other material they have requested. Make sure you have the item they

</div>
</aside>
<p data-aid="128202238" id="p104">The principle of accountability is 
fundamental in God’s eternal plan. We will all stand before the Lord at 
the last judgment and give an accounting for what we have done with the 
opportunities He has given us (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.15-19?lang=eng#p15">Alma 5:15–19</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.9?lang=eng#p9">Doctrine and Covenants 137:9</a>).
 There is much you can learn about accountability on your mission that 
will benefit you throughout your life. The principle of accountability 
will bless you if you:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202239" id="p105">Approach your goal setting and 
planning with the idea that you will account for your efforts to your 
mission leaders and to the Lord through prayer.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202242" id="p108"><span class="page-break" data-page="155"></span>Choose
 to be proactive in accounting for your work to the Lord and to your 
mission leaders. Don’t wait to be asked. Don’t require others to follow 
up with you frequently. Have a desire to account for your labor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202243" id="p109">Accept full responsibility for your efforts. Never blame others for difficult circumstances or lack of progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202244" id="p110">Seek to learn from your leaders, and invite them to suggest ways you can improve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202245" id="p111">Be motivated to do your best work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128202246" id="p112">Accountability does not come only at 
the end of your mission. It is a principle that influences how you 
begin, how you think and feel about the responsibility the Lord has 
given you, how you approach your work, and how well you endure. The 
attitude you have toward your mission experience is a reflection of your
 love toward your Heavenly Father and His Son and your respect for the 
priesthood.</p>
<p data-aid="128202247" id="p113">As you pray personally and in your 
companionship, seek inspiration on what you should do each day. As you 
follow your plans, pray and ask the Lord for guidance. Have a prayer in 
your heart throughout the day that the Spirit will help you know where 
to go, what to do, and what to say. Ask yourself, “What more can I do?” 
In your prayer at the end of the day, give an accounting of your work.</p>
<p data-aid="128202248" id="p114">You will give an accounting each week 
to your mission leaders during your weekly report, during district 
council, and in other settings throughout the week. If you are a mission
 leader, you will receive this information from other missionaries. Show
 an interest in their lives and in the lives of those they teach rather 
than simply in numbers. Do not use these tools or the information you 
receive as ways to control or manipulate. The information you receive 
through these tools will provide you with opportunities to praise 
missionaries for their dedication and to see opportunities for future 
training.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202271" id="p116">Take a few moments and think about your final day in the mission field. When that day comes:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202272" id="p117">What do you want to say you have done as a missionary?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202273" id="p118">What do you want to have become?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202274" id="p119">What differences would you want others to notice in you?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128202275" id="p120">In your study journal, write an answer
 to each of these questions. Determine what you need to do now to 
realize these goals. Write the plans that come to mind.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202277" id="p121">Using your area book, answer the questions below:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202278" id="p122">Are all the records current, accurate, and easy to read?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202279" id="p123">Would a missionary who is new to the 
area be able to review the area book and know where people are in their 
spiritual progress and what more needs to be done to help them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202280" id="p124">Would a missionary who is new to the area benefit from your efforts to find new people to teach?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202281" id="p125">Picture yourself presenting your area 
book to the Lord as you give an accounting of how you have cared for the
 people in your area. Would the Lord be pleased with your efforts?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202282" id="p126">Discuss one person you are teaching. 
In your Missionary Daily Planner, locate the page titled “Events That 
Lead to Baptism, Confirmation, and Activity in the Church.” Select one 
event, and make a list of everything you need to do in order for this 
event to happen. Discuss how you might plan these tasks so that the 
event can happen at the earliest possible time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202283" id="p127">Discuss the following analogy with your companion. Evaluate how long your “line” is in the water each day.</p>
<p data-aid="128202284" id="p128">“None of us should be like the 
fisherman who thinks he has been fishing all day when in reality he has 
spent most of his time getting to and from the water, eating lunch, and 
fussing with his equipment. Fishing success is related to how long you 
have your line in the water, not to how long you are away from the 
apartment. Some fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have 
their line in the water for ten hours. Other fishermen are away from 
home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for only two 
hours. This last type may wonder why they do not have the same success 
as others.</p>
<p data-aid="128202285" id="p129">“The same principle applies to 
missionaries, whom the Master called ‘fishers of men.’ A missionary’s 
line should drop into the fishing water the moment he or she leaves the 
apartment” (Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks, seminar for new mission presidents, 
June 20, 2000).</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202287" id="p130">Read one of the following situations 
to the missionaries. In small groups, have the missionaries discuss 
goals and plans that will help the people in these examples progress 
toward baptism and confirmation. Have each group share their ideas.</p>
<p data-aid="128202288" id="p131"><span class="page-break" data-page="157"></span> <i>Situation one:</i>
 You met Larry and Beth when they were giving service at a food kitchen.
 You have taught them one lesson, and now they want to know more. They 
do not know any members of the Church. Beth is Christian, and Larry does
 not claim any particular religion. They are not married but do live 
together. Larry works from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. Beth works 
daytime hours.</p>
<p data-aid="128202289" id="p132"><i>Situation two:</i> Steve has taken 
all the lessons and attends church at least twice a month. He believes 
that Joseph Smith is a prophet and that the Book of Mormon is true. His 
family members are devout Catholics and do not approve of his meetings 
with the missionaries.</p>
<p data-aid="128202290" id="p133"><i>Situation three:</i> Jill is a 
college student. She has a friend who is a member of the Church. Her 
member friend invited her to meet with you. You have taught her two 
lessons. Her member friend was present at both. She has not attended 
church yet and is so busy with her homework that it is difficult for her
 to read from the Book of Mormon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202291" id="p134">Invite missionaries to share experiences where, through setting goals and making plans, they have been able to help people:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202292" id="p135">Develop greater faith in the Savior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202293" id="p136">Repent and make changes that have brought them closer to God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202294" id="p137">Receive the covenant of baptism and confirmation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202295" id="p138">Come back to the Church and renew their baptismal covenant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202296" id="p139">Divide the missionaries into three 
groups. Explain that each group will receive an important assignment. 
Then give each group one of the following tasks:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202297" id="p140">Open a new teaching area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202298" id="p141">Prepare a zone conference training session on introducing the Book of Mormon to people who are interested in learning more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202299" id="p142">Integrate a family you are teaching 
into the ward. The family has three children: an 8-year-old girl, a 
12-year-old girl, and a 16-year-old boy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128202300" id="p143">Tell the missionaries they have eight 
minutes to develop a plan. One of the missionaries should write the plan
 down, including the daily activities.</p>
<p data-aid="128202301" id="p144">Have each group present its plan. After each presentation, ask:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202302" id="p145">What did the missionaries need to know in each situation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202303" id="p146">What might the result be if you do not plan meaningful activities or do not plan at all?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128202304" id="p147">After all the presentations, ask:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202305" id="p148">How are planning and goal setting acts of love? acts of faith?</p>
</li>
</ul>
