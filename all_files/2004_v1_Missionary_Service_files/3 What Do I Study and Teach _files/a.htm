essential doctrine, principles, and commandments that you are to study, 
believe, love, live, and teach. They are what the living prophets and 
apostles have directed you to teach. They are organized so that you can 
help others clearly understand the doctrine of Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="128204151" id="p2">The lessons in this chapter are:</p>

<p data-aid="128204157" id="p8">Teach all of the lessons before baptism.
 Make sure those you teach qualify for baptism and confirmation by 
making and keeping all of the commitments in these lessons.</p>
<p data-aid="137163619" id="p14">Each lesson contains a list of 
invitations for others to make and keep certain commitments. Help those 
you teach understand that accepting an invitation to make and keep a 
commitment can prepare them to make and keep covenants with the Lord. </p>
<p data-aid="128204158" id="p9">Full-time missionaries take the lead in 
teaching all of the lessons before baptism and again after baptism, with
 the help of ward missionaries and other members. After baptism, 
encourage each new member to keep all the commitments in these lessons.</p>
<p data-aid="128204159" id="p10">You should also use these lessons in 
individual and companion study, district council, and other training 
settings. As you study the scriptures and treasure up in your mind the 
doctrine in these lessons, the Spirit will give you in the very hour 
what you should say and do to help others receive a witness of the 
truthfulness of the teachings.</p>
<p data-aid="128204160" id="p11">As a missionary, you have a great 
responsibility to teach from the heart and by the Spirit. The First 
Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated: “Our purpose is
 to teach the message of the restored gospel in such a way as to allow 
the Spirit to direct <span class="page-break" data-page="30"></span>both
 the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the 
concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote 
presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as 
prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but 
speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of 
the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the 
interest and needs of the [person]. Speaking out of his own conviction 
and in his own words he should bear testimony of the truth of his 
teachings” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, 
Dec. 11, 2002). As you and your companion study these lessons and 
prepare to teach, keep these instructions firmly in mind. Make sure that
 you teach all the doctrine in these lessons.</p>
<p data-aid="128204161" id="p12">Let the Spirit guide the order in which
 you present the first three lessons based on the person’s needs, 
interests, and situation. A few of the commandments may also be included
 as appropriate or be taught as lessons of their own. Prayerfully decide
 what to teach and which invitations to extend. Be mindful of the 
person’s questions and level of understanding.</p>
<p data-aid="128204162" id="p13">Each lesson outlines the baptismal 
interview questions, commitments, and doctrine that you are to teach. 
Thoroughly learn the doctrine. Consistently focus on helping those you 
teach make and keep the commitments. Use the baptismal interview 
questions to prepare those you teach for baptism and confirmation. The 
lessons also have ideas for teaching. Use these suggestions to 
strengthen how you prepare and teach.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128204164" id="figure2_p1">Memorize scriptures to use in 
your teaching. Commit to memory the sequence of the doctrinal points in 
each of the missionary lessons. Missionaries learning a second language 
should focus their language study on preparing to teach the missionary 
lessons. They should memorize vocabulary, phrases, sentence patterns, 
and brief statements of doctrine as they appear in the lesson, but only 
after these have become personally meaningful. Do not memorize entire 
lessons.</p>

<p data-aid="128204166" id="figure3_p1">At the end of the first three 
lessons is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach. 
Learn how to define these words simply. As you teach, do all you can to 
make the message easy to understand.</p>
