<h2 data-aid="128199138" id="title2">Prepare Yourself Spiritually</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199139" id="p1">The Lord declared, “Every man shall hear
 the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, 
through those who are ordained unto this power” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.11?lang=eng#p11">Doctrine and Covenants 90:11</a>).
 Strengthen your personal testimony to bring converting power to your 
words. First study the doctrine and the lessons in your native language.
 That understanding will strengthen your testimony and your capacity to 
teach and testify convincingly. You can then learn to express the 
message of the Restoration in your mission language under the guidance 
of the Spirit.</p>
<p data-aid="128199140" id="p2">Listed below are ways you can strengthen your faith that the Lord will help you teach and testify in your mission language:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199141" id="p3">Recognize that you have been called of God by a prophet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199142" id="p4">Live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199143" id="p5">Be obedient to the commandments and to missionary standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199144" id="p6">Pray sincerely for divine assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="137171535" id="p106">Seek the gifts of the Spirit, including the gift of tongues and the gift of interpretation of tongues.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199148" id="title3"><span class="page-break" data-page="134"></span>Be Dedicated and Diligent</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199150" id="p8">Learning to teach effectively in your 
mission language requires diligent effort and the gifts of the Spirit. 
Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first. Learning a language
 takes time. Be patient with yourself. Listen carefully, speak the 
language often, learn new vocabulary, and practice grammar and 
pronunciation every day. Seek the help of your companion, members, those
 you teach, and other missionaries.</p>
<p data-aid="128199153" id="p9">Do not stop improving your language 
skills once people begin to understand you. As your ability to speak the
 language grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you
 say it. You will be less worried about how to communicate the feelings 
that are in your heart. You will be better able to respond to the needs 
of those you teach and the promptings of the Spirit.</p>
<p data-aid="128199155" id="p10">Strive to master the language 
throughout your mission and after you return. The Lord has invested much
 in you, and He may have uses for your language abilities later in your 
life. Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland explained: “We would … hope that 
every missionary learning a new … language would master it in every way 
possible. … And as you do so, your [teaching] and testifying skills will
 improve. You will be better received by and more spiritually impressive
 to [the people you teach]. … Don’t be satisfied with what we call a 
missionary vocabulary only. Stretch yourself in the language, and you 
will gain greater access to the hearts of the people” (missionary 
satellite broadcast, Aug. 1998).</p>
<p data-aid="128199158" id="p11">You are not alone in learning your 
mission language. Whenever the Lord gives a commandment, He provides a 
way to accomplish it (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7?lang=eng#p7">1&nbsp;Nephi 3:7</a>).
 Seek His help. Be dedicated in your study. In time you will acquire the
 language skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a missionary.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128199163" id="p12">If you do not speak English, you should
 study it as a missionary. This will bless you during your mission and 
throughout your life. Learning English will enable you to help build the
 Lord’s kingdom in additional ways and will be a blessing for you and 
your family. Many of the suggestions found in this chapter will help 
you. Focus particularly on the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199165" id="p13">Set a goal to speak English with your 
companion. If your companion already knows English and is trying to 
learn your language, you might choose to speak English in the apartment 
and the mission language when you go out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199168" id="p14">With your companion, read from the Book
 of Mormon in English. You might also choose to alternate: You read a 
verse in English, and then your companion reads a verse in the mission 
language. Correct each other’s pronunciation and intonation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199170" id="p15">Ask your mission president for suggestions on a simple English grammar text if you do not already have one.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199173" id="title5">Principles of Language Learning</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199175" id="p16">This section describes principles to help you study and learn the language more effectively.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199178" id="p17"><strong>Take responsibility.</strong> Regularly create or adjust your language learning goals and study plan. Strive to use the language at every opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199180" id="p18"><span class="page-break" data-page="135"></span><strong>Make your study meaningful.</strong>
 Ask yourself: Why am I studying this? How will it help me communicate 
better? Relate what you study to real-life situations and daily 
activities. Study parts of the language that will help you say what you 
want to say. For example, if there is a scripture story you would like 
to include in your teaching, learn the vocabulary and grammar necessary 
to relate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199183" id="p19"><strong>Seek to communicate.</strong> 
Seek to find an appropriate balance between studying grammar and the 
structure of the language and learning through your daily activities. 
There is no substitute for talking with native speakers of the language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199185" id="p20"><strong>Learn new concepts thoroughly.</strong>
 You will be able to recall and effectively use language principles if 
you review regularly what you have studied and if you practice it again 
in new situations.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199188" id="title6">Create a Language Study Plan</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199190" id="p21">A language study plan helps both new 
and experienced missionaries focus on what they can do each day to 
improve their ability to speak the mission language. Your plan will 
include what you will do during your language study time and what you 
will do throughout the day.</p>
<p data-aid="128199193" id="p22">As needed, use some of your language 
study time to create or adjust your study plan. Then during your 
language study time, learn the language needed for the day’s activities.
 The following guidelines will help you in creating your own language 
learning plan:</p>
<ol class="decimal" start="1">
<li data-marker="1.">
<p data-aid="128199195" id="p23"><strong>Set goals.</strong> Weekly and 
daily goals will help you learn your mission language. Focus your goals 
on improving your ability to communicate and teach during scheduled 
activities, such as teaching appointments, finding opportunities, and 
ward council meetings. Review your progress in achieving your language 
goals. Ask yourself what you can do to communicate with greater clarity 
and power during your scheduled activities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p data-aid="128199242" id="p42">Use the grammar text you received at

<p data-aid="128199254" id="p47">Listen carefully to native speakers. Imitate what you hear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199257" id="p48">When you hear something you do not

it. However, as a servant of the Lord, always use appropriate language, 
not slang.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199264" id="p51">Make a list of things people might say

<li data-marker="6.">
<p data-aid="128199267" id="p52"><strong>Improve your ability to read and write.</strong>
 Read the Book of Mormon in your mission language to learn vocabulary 
and phrases and to practice grammar, pronunciation, and fluency. There 
is great power in using the scriptures in your language study. Also 
consider the following ideas:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199269" id="p53">Learn to read and write the alphabet, 
script, or characters of your language. For character-based writing 
systems, focus on reading skills, such as scripture reading, that will 
help you when you teach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199272" id="p54">Read out loud from the Book of Mormon, 
other scriptures, or Church magazines in your mission language. Pay 
attention to unfamiliar vocabulary, phrases, and grammar. If you do not 
understand a word, try to understand its meaning from the context of the
 passage before you look it up. Add the word to your note cards. Use 
your native-language and mission-language scriptures side-by-side if 
necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199274" id="p55">Have someone coach you on pronunciation, intonation, and pauses as you read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199277" id="p56"><span class="page-break" data-page="137"></span>Practice
 writing in your mission language—for example, personal notes and 
reminders, letters, thank-you notes, and notes of encouragement. Write 
your testimony in copies of the Book of Mormon that you distribute.</p>

 the appropriate language for prayer and to learn to speak what is in 
your heart.</p>
<p data-aid="128199300" id="p65">Do not be afraid of making mistakes. 
Everyone who learns a new language makes mistakes. People will 
understand, and they will appreciate your efforts to learn their 
language. Memorizing phrases and scriptures will help you avoid 
mistakes, but you should not use lengthy memorized or prepared scripts 
as a way to avoid mistakes.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128199311" id="p66">Help your companions experience success
 and gain confidence in learning the language as rapidly as possible. 
Sincerely and frequently compliment your companions and other 
missionaries on their progress. Be sensitive not to say or do anything 
that might weaken their confidence, but don’t protect them so much that 
they do not learn. Do not withhold help when it is needed. Give them 
many opportunities to teach and testify successfully. Consider the 
following ideas for learning with your companions:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199313" id="p67">Teach each other the grammar and vocabulary you have learned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199316" id="p68"><span class="page-break" data-page="138"></span>Practice
 teaching in the mission language. At first, new missionaries might 
teach very simply, share a simple testimony, and recite memorized 
scriptures. As their confidence and ability increase, they will be able 
to participate more fully in teaching others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199318" id="p69">Practice using the language to communicate in common missionary situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199321" id="p70">Give each other simple and practical 
feedback with kindness. It is also important that you receive feedback 
without taking offense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199323" id="p71">Note how a more experienced missionary helped his companion in the following true account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199326" id="p72">I had just arrived in my second area 
when my companion told me it was my turn to give the spiritual thought 
at a dinner appointment. I was more than just a little scared. My first 
companion had always been happy to do the teaching, and I was used to 
giving my small portion of the lesson and then listening as he would 
then expound and answer any questions.</p>
<p data-aid="128199328" id="p73">I tried to convince my companion that 
he should give the spiritual thought, but he encouraged me to take the 
assignment. I practiced with his help.</p>
<p data-aid="128199331" id="p74">When the moment arrived, I opened my scriptures and read from <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5?lang=eng">3&nbsp;Nephi 5</a> and <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng">7</a>.
 I struggled but managed to explain why I felt my chosen passages were 
significant, and I was relieved when I was done. When a question was 
asked, I looked to my companion to answer, but he didn’t open his mouth.
 That was when I amazed myself by coming up with an answer in 
understandable French. I was even more amazed that the member didn’t 
seem to sense that I was insecure about my communication skills. I 
gained confidence and realized that my French was better than I gave 
myself credit for.</p>
<p data-aid="128199333" id="p75">The weeks passed, and my companion 
continued to let me teach—even when I didn’t think I could do it, even 
when he probably wondered if I could do it. And because he encouraged me
 to speak, listen, and teach, my language skills began to progress more 
quickly, and I felt that I had become a tool of our Father in Heaven 
instead of being simply another elder’s quiet companion.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199344" id="title8">Culture and Language Learning</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199346" id="p76">Culture and language are closely 
related. Understanding the culture will help explain why language is 
used the way it is. Strive to understand the culture of the people so 
that you can communicate the unique aspects of the message of the 
Restoration in a way that will be clear to them.</p>
<p data-aid="128199349" id="p77">One of the greatest things you can do 
to gain people’s trust and love is to embrace their culture in 
appropriate ways. Many great missionaries have done so (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/9.20-23?lang=eng#p20">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:20–23</a>). Seek to have the people feel comfortable with you and your language.</p>

<li>
<p data-aid="128199354" id="figure5_p1">Imagine that you are serving a 
mission in Asia. You are preparing to teach someone about resurrection, 
and you know that Buddhists believe in reincarnation. How will you teach
 about resurrection in such a way that the person will understand that 
this doctrine is distinctly different from reincarnation? What words and
 phrases might you need to learn to accomplish this task?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199356" id="figure5_p2">Think about the cultural and 
religious background of the people you teach. Identify an aspect of 
their background that might lead them to misunderstand the doctrine of 
the gospel. Plan ways to teach this doctrine clearly.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199359" id="title9"><span class="page-break" data-page="139"></span>The Gift of Tongues</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199362" id="p78">Gifts of the Spirit are real. The gift 
of tongues and the gift of the interpretation of tongues can help you as
 much or more than any other single thing to speak and understand the 
language of the people in your mission.</p>
<p data-aid="137171537" id="p108">The gift of tongues and the 
interpretation of tongues has many manifestations, including speaking 
and understanding an unknown language as an endowment of the Spirit. It 
also includes speaking and understanding a known language with or 
without the aid of study.</p>
<p data-aid="137171538" id="p109">Today, the gift of tongues and the 
interpretation of tongues is most often manifested in Spirit-enhanced 
learning and studying to speak and understand a mission language. 
Additionally, the Holy Ghost can manifest the truth of your testimony 
even though a language barrier may exist between you and those you 
teach. Likewise, the Holy Ghost can bring words and phrases to your 
remembrance and help you understand what people are saying from their 
hearts as you teach people in a mission language.</p>
<p data-aid="137171539" id="p110">For the most part, you will not obtain
 these gifts without effort; you need to actively seek them. Part of 
seeking the gift of tongues is to labor and struggle and to do all you 
can to learn the language. Be patient as you prayerfully study and 
practice the language. Trust that the Spirit will help you as you live 
the way you should and do your very best. Have faith that you can have 
the gift of tongues in its true and most comprehensive sense.</p>
<p data-aid="128199364" id="p79">When you feel you are struggling to 
express yourself as clearly as you would like, remember that the Spirit 
is able to speak to the hearts of all of God’s children. President 
Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson taught: “There is one language … that is common to
 each missionary—the language of the Spirit. It is not learned from 
textbooks written by men of letters, nor is it acquired through reading 
and memorization. The language of the Spirit comes to him who seeks with
 all his heart to know God and keep His divine commandments. Proficiency
 in this language permits one to breach barriers, overcome obstacles, 
and touch the human heart” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1997/06/the-spirit-giveth-life?lang=eng&amp;para=p6#p6">The Spirit Giveth Life</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> June 1997, 2).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199389" id="p82">Read and discuss the following 
statement by Elder Richard&nbsp;G. Scott: “Where … national traditions 
or customs conflict with the teachings of God, set them aside. Where 
traditions and customs are in harmony with His teachings, they should be
 cherished” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1998/04/removing-barriers-to-happiness?lang=eng&amp;para=p27#p27">Removing Barriers to Happiness</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite>
 May 1998, 87). Think about the ways that the culture in the area where 
you serve is different from your own. Make a list of the differences. 
Then cross out any that conflict with the teachings of the gospel. 
Consider each of those that remain, and think about how you can make 
these customs your own.</p>
