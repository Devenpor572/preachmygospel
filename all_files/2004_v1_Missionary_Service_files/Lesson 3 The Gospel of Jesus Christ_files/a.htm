</header>
<p data-aid="128201412" id="p1">God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, 
into the world so that all of God’s children would have the possibility 
of experiencing joy and peace in this world and everlasting life in the 
world to come with their families. Additionally, through Jesus Christ 
all God’s children will live again when their bodies and spirits are 
reunited in the Resurrection (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.40-42?lang=eng#p40">Doctrine and Covenants 76:40–42</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="137163623" id="p53">As the result of Adam and Eve’s 
transgression, death is experienced by all people. And because all 
people have made mistakes and sinned, they are unable to return to live 
with God because “no unclean thing can dwell” in His presence (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.21?lang=eng#p21">1&nbsp;Nephi 10:21</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="137163625" id="p54">However, through the Savior’s grace and
 mercy we will live again as resurrected beings and can be clean from 
sin so that we can live in our Heavenly Father’s presence. Becoming 
clean from sin is being healed spiritually (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.13?lang=eng#p13">3&nbsp;Nephi 9:13</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.32?lang=eng#p32">18:32</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128201413" id="p2">Because of the Savior’s sacrifice, known
 as the Atonement of Christ, all people will be brought back into the 
presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their 
desires (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.10-16?lang=eng#p10">2&nbsp;Nephi 9:10–16</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.15-18?lang=eng#p15">Helaman 14:15–18</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.14-22?lang=eng#p14">3&nbsp;Nephi 27:14–22</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.9?lang=eng#p9">Doctrine and Covenants 137:9</a>) and will be raised from the dead. We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy.</p>
<p data-aid="128201414" id="p3"><span class="page-break" data-page="61"></span>Justice
 is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings 
for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We 
all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in 
God’s presence (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.21?lang=eng#p21">1&nbsp;Nephi 10:21</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.19?lang=eng#p19">3&nbsp;Nephi 27:19</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.57?lang=eng#p57">Moses 6:57</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128201415" id="p4">The Savior satisfied the demands of 
justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of 
His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for
 our sins. This act is called the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Because of 
this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. 
Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and 
welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He 
forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence.</p>
<p data-aid="128201416" id="p5">However, Jesus did not eliminate our 
personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, 
repent, and obey His commandments. Through Jesus Christ’s Atonement and 
living the gospel we can enter the presence of our Heavenly Father 
permanently. We show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him
 by doing His will and keeping His commandments, including obeying the 
first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Nephi refers to these 
principles and ordinances as “the doctrine of Christ” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.2?lang=eng#p2">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:2</a>–<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.1-6?lang=eng#p1">32:6</a>).</p>

<p class="title" data-aid="128201417" id="figure2_title1">Sin</p>
</header>
<p data-aid="128201418" id="figure2_p1">The notion of “sin” means 
different things in different cultures. In some cultures it is closely 
associated with the concept of committing crime. In others it applies 
only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a 
family or community. Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s 
commandments and results in becoming separated from God. God knows all 
that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin. Do not discuss 
your past transgressions or ask those you teach to discuss their past 
transgressions.</p>

<p data-aid="137163631" id="p55">The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.12?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 42:12</a>).
 It also contains the clearest presentation of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, sometimes referred to as the doctrine of Christ, found anywhere

<p data-aid="137163634" id="p56">According to the Book of Mormon the 
gospel of Jesus Christ includes five key points: (1)&nbsp;faith in the

<p data-aid="128203524" id="p6">The gospel of Jesus Christ begins with 
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a
 firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and 
Redeemer of the world. It is to believe there is no “salvation in any 
other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, 
whereby we must be saved” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/4.12?lang=eng#p12">Acts 4:12</a>). There are other things that we need to believe if we are to have faith in Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.13-15?lang=eng#p13">3&nbsp;Nephi 27:13–15</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="137163638" id="p58">We recognize that we can return to live
 with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. 
When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His 
teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power 
to keep His promises. We can develop faith in Christ through humility 
and doing His will and keeping His commandments. Heavenly Father blesses
 those who have faith to listen to and obey His Son.</p>
<p data-aid="128203526" id="p7">Faith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting change. Having faith causes us to try as <span class="page-break" data-page="62"></span>hard
 as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior with “unshaken
 faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to 
save” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.19?lang=eng#p19">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:19</a>).
 We want to learn His will and keep His commandments. Even though we 
will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving through 
the power of Christ’s Atonement to keep His commandments and avoid sin.</p>
<p data-aid="128203528" id="p8">We believe in Christ, and we believe 
that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We show our faith by 
obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. As we 
live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by 
experience (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/7.17?lang=eng#p17">John 7:17</a>). We also grow in faith by hearing and reading the word of God (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/10.17?lang=eng#p17">Romans 10:17</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Helaman 15:7–8</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128203530" id="p9">As we obey God, He blesses us. He gives 
us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of 
our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both 
physically and spiritually.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128203573" id="title4">Repentance through the Atonement of Jesus Christ</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128203575" id="p10">Repentance through the Atonement of 
Jesus Christ is another important principle of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or 
to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony 
with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, 
ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow and 
return to Him with full purpose of heart. We stop doing things that are 
wrong and continue doing things that are right. Bringing our lives in 
line with God’s will through repentance and faith on Jesus Christ is a 
central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father 
only through Christ’s grace and mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy on 
the condition of repentance.</p>
<p data-aid="128203577" id="p11">To repent, we recognize our sins and 
feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also 
confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who will 
support us as we truly repent. We ask God to forgive us. We do all we 
can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called 
restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. 
As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need 
not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely 
repent, we turn away from our sins and do them no more. We resist any 
desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and 
deeper.</p>
<p data-aid="128203579" id="p12">Sincere repentance brings several 
results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt
 and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in 
greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more 
prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son.</p>
<p data-aid="128203581" id="p13"><span class="page-break" data-page="63"></span>Even
 after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall 
short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these 
transgressions, remembering we “can do all things through Christ which 
strengtheneth” us (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13?lang=eng#p13">Philippians 4:13</a>).
 In addition, we should continually improve—develop Christlike 
qualities, grow in knowledge, and serve more effectively. As we learn 
more about what the Savior wants for us, we will want to show our love 
by obeying Him. Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives 
will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more 
Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily.</p>

<p data-aid="128203618" id="p14">Faith in Jesus Christ and repentance 
prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance 
is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a 
covenant with God.</p>
<p data-aid="128203620" id="p15">God has always required His children to
 make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between 
God and His children. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey 
Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or 
reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation 
in the life to come.</p>
<p data-aid="128203622" id="p16">Covenants place us under a strong 
obligation to honor our promises to God. We should desire to worthily 
receive the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. 
Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives, relying upon 
Jesus Christ. By loving the Lord, keeping His commandments, and loving 
and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins through
 “him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/1.5?lang=eng#p5">Revelation 1:5</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128203624" id="p17">Covenants are usually made by means of 
sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by
 priesthood authority in the name of Jesus Christ. Through the ordinance
 of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of
 Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we 
keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship 
of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again.</p>
<p data-aid="128203626" id="p18"><span class="page-break" data-page="64"></span>Through sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.20?lang=eng#p20">Doctrine and Covenants 84:20</a>).
 Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, 
or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of 
salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized
 by the Lord’s authorized servant. Christ set the example for us by 
being baptized.</p>
<p data-aid="128203628" id="p19">Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the
 death, burial, and Resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it 
represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new
 life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a 
rebirth. When we are baptized we begin the process of being born again 
and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Mosiah 5:7–8</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8.14-17?lang=eng#p14">Romans 8:14–17</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128203630" id="p20">We must be baptized to become members 
of His kingdom on earth, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is
 a law of God and must be performed by His authority and in His name 
(see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28.19-20?lang=eng#p19">Matthew 28:19–20</a>). A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation.</p>
<p data-aid="128203632" id="p21">Little children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.4-24?lang=eng#p4">Moroni 8:4–24</a>). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.27?lang=eng#p27">Doctrine and Covenants 68:27</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128203634" id="p22">Before baptism we show our willingness 
to enter a covenant to keep all the commandments for the rest of our 
lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenant. We also 
regularly renew the covenant we make when baptized by partaking of the 
sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps 
us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly 
reminder of our covenant. Jesus Christ introduced this ordinance to His 
Apostles just before His Atonement. He restored it through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. The Savior commanded that priesthood holders should 
administer the sacrament in remembrance of His body and His blood, which
 was shed for us. By partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise 
always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive 
anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us.</p>

<p data-aid="128203638" id="figure6_p1">Ensure that those you teach have
 developed faith in Christ, repented of transgressions by relying upon 
the sacrifice of the Savior, and made sufficient changes in their lives 
to qualify as commanded in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>.
 Those you teach “must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, 
having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men 
[and women]” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#p20">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:20</a>).
 Additionally, they must promise to live the principles of moral 
worthiness, obey the Word of Wisdom, and obey the law of tithing. If you
 feel additional preparation is needed, you should postpone baptism 
until those you teach meet the standard outlined by the Lord in 
scripture. (See “Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter,
 Dec. 11, 2002.)</p>
<p data-aid="128203640" id="figure6_p2">“Before baptism each [person] 
should receive all the missionary [lessons], meet the bishop or branch 
president, and attend several sacrament meetings” (“Statement on

<h2 data-aid="128203709" id="title6">The Gift of the Holy Ghost</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128203711" id="p23">Jesus taught that we must be baptized 
of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by 
baptism of fire and of the Spirit or it is incomplete (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13-14?lang=eng#p13">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:13–14</a>).
 Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we 
receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually 
reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="128203713" id="p24">The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, 
cleansing effect upon us. Through the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, 
we can receive and retain a remission of sins through continued faith in
 Christ, repentance, and following the will of God and obedience to His 
commandments.</p>
<p data-aid="128203715" id="p25">Those who receive the gift of the Holy 
Ghost and remain worthy can enjoy His companionship throughout their 
lives. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the 
truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He 
comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or
 physical danger. The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach 
and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s 
most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel 
God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy
 and a promise of eternal life and exaltation.</p>
<p data-aid="137163641" id="p59">After a person is baptized by water, 
one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the 
person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. They then confer the gift of the Holy 
Ghost.</p>
<p data-aid="128203717" id="p26">The priesthood authority needed to 
perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through the death 
of the Savior’s Apostles, was restored through angelic administration to
 a modern prophet, Joseph Smith. Only through membership in The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can one receive the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, the right to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion. 
This authority makes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
different from any other religion in the world. By the Lord’s own 
declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the
 whole earth” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.30?lang=eng#p30">Doctrine and Covenants 1:30</a>).</p>

they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the 
commandments. Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy 
Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128203764" id="title7">Endure to the End</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="137163645" id="p60">The gospel of Jesus Christ includes 
obtaining and increasing our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting of our 
sins through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, being baptized by immersion 
by an authorized servant of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ, 
receiving baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, 
and enduring to the end.</p>
<p data-aid="137163647" id="p61">Enduring to the end does not simply 
mean holding on until we die. Enduring to the end includes obtaining 
Christlike attributes through the Savior’s Atonement. Enduring to the 
end includes following the Father’s will and obeying His commandments, 
fasting, prayer, scripture study, observing the Sabbath day, repenting, 
and making and keeping sacred temple covenants.</p>
<p data-aid="128203766" id="p27">Once we have entered the strait and 
narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances
 of baptism and confirmation, we must exert every effort to stay on the 
path. We do so by continually exercising faith in and relying upon Jesus
 Christ, repenting, making commitments, and following the Spirit.</p>
<p data-aid="128203768" id="p28">Once we have been forgiven of our sins,
 we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always 
have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our 
Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our 
lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings
 of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow 
the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is 
often called “enduring to the end.”</p>
<p data-aid="128203770" id="p29">By following the gospel path, we can 
draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of 
the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and 
consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for 
exaltation (see <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-2-the-plan-of-salvation?lang=eng&amp;para=title8#title8">page 53</a> for additional information regarding the difference between salvation and exaltation).</p>
<p data-aid="128203772" id="p30">Faith in Christ; repentance; making, 
renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become
 a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed 
by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we 
gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this 
way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ … and endure to 
the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” and exaltation (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#p20">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:20</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.17?lang=eng#p17">Doctrine and Covenants 132:17</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128203836" id="figure13_p1">Our message is one of faith and
 hope. We love and worship Jesus Christ. He is central to God’s plan for
 our happiness. Christ’s atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to 
have exaltation in the presence of God. As we live His gospel, He will 
mercifully forgive our sins. He will heal us and replace guilt and shame
 with peace and happiness in this life.</p>
<p data-aid="128203838" id="figure13_p2">The gospel of Jesus Christ is 
simple. It begins with faith in Christ. We believe in Him, trust Him, 
and depend on Him. Such faith leads us to repent—to stop doing things 
that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. Our faith in 
Him also makes us want to show our love by keeping His commandments, 
including baptism. After baptism, He promises to give us the gift of the
 Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will guide us, comfort us, and help us know 
the truth. We can know in our hearts <span class="page-break" data-page="68"></span>and
 our minds when the Holy Ghost is with us. We will have feelings of 
peace, love, and joy. We will want to serve others. We will strive 
throughout our lives to please the Lord.</p>
<p data-aid="128203840" id="figure13_p3">Jesus Christ has restored His 
gospel through a latter-day prophet. We learn about the gospel in the 
Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about. God will 
tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true. As you come to 
know it is true, you will want to repent and be baptized so that you may
 receive a remission of your sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

</header>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128203948" id="p38"><strong>Confirmation:</strong> The 
laying on of hands by those holding the Melchizedek Priesthood in order 
to become a member of the Church and to receive the gift of the Holy 
Ghost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203950" id="p39"><strong>Covenant:</strong> An agreement
 between God and His children. We do not act as equals in the agreement.
 God gives the conditions for the covenant, and we agree to do what He 
asks us to do. God then promises us certain blessings for our obedience.
 We receive ordinances by covenant. When we make such covenants, we 
promise to honor them. For example, members of the Church covenant with 
the Lord at baptism and renew that covenant by partaking of the 
sacrament. We make further covenants in the temple. The Lord’s people 
are a covenant people. We are greatly blessed as we keep our covenants 
with the Lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203951" id="p40"><strong>Endure to the end:</strong> To 
remain true to the commandments of God and be true to the endowment and 
sealing ordinances of the temple despite temptation, opposition, and 
adversity throughout life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203952" id="p41"><strong>Exaltation:</strong> To live forever as families in God’s presence (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.19-20?lang=eng#p19">Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–20</a>). Exaltation is God’s greatest gift to His sons and daughters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203953" id="p42"><strong>Gospel:</strong> God’s plan of 
salvation, made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The 
gospel includes the eternal truths or laws, covenants, and ordinances 
needed for mankind to return to the presence of God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203954" id="p43"><strong>Grace:</strong> The enabling 
power from Jesus Christ that allows us to obtain blessings in this life 
and to gain eternal life and exaltation after we have exercised faith, 
repented, and given our best effort to keep the commandments. Such 
divine help or strength is given through the mercy and love of Jesus 
Christ. We all need divine grace because of Adam and Eve’s Fall and also
 because of our weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203955" id="p44"><strong>Mercy:</strong> The spirit of 
compassion, tenderness, and forgiveness. Mercy is one of the attributes 
of God. Jesus Christ offers mercy to us through His atoning sacrifice on
 conditions of repentance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203956" id="p45"><strong>Restitution:</strong> The return of something that has been taken away or lost.</p>
