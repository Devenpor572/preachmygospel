<p data-aid="136329858" id="p1">Use <cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> to 
meet your needs as a missionary as you become a more deeply committed 
disciple of Jesus Christ. You can spend an entire study session on just a
 few paragraphs—or an entire chapter. You can study chapters in order or
 plan another sequence that better meets your needs. This flexibility 
allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by 
your mission president.</p>
<p data-aid="136329859" id="p2">All of the chapters in <cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary. However, as you begin to study <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/what-do-i-study-and-teach?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;3</a>,
 you may sense a difference in approach. Most of the chapters are 
addressed to you. Chapter&nbsp;3 is addressed to a more general 
audience. You learn the doctrine in chapter&nbsp;3 (a)&nbsp;to 
strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony and (b)&nbsp;to teach
 others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants.</p>
<p data-aid="136329860" id="p3">The doctrine in some of the other chapters may also help you teach people. For example, chapter&nbsp;4, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-recognize-and-understand-the-spirit?lang=eng">How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?</a>” may help you teach people about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. Chapter&nbsp;5, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/what-is-the-role-of-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng">What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?</a>” may help you resolve someone’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon. Ideas from chapter&nbsp;2, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-study-effectively-and-prepare-to-teach?lang=eng">How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?</a>” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p data-aid="128201319" id="p4"><cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> focuses on
 the essentials of missionary work. It does not answer every question or
 situation you will encounter. You will be most effective as you follow 
the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what
 you learn.</p>
<p data-aid="136329861" id="p5">Study the chapters throughout your 
mission. Apply what you learn. Evaluate your work. Missionaries who 
strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will 
receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="136329862" id="p6">You have the flexibility to teach the 
lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for their 
baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the 
material; it is to help others come unto Christ through the first 
principles of the gospel, including faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, 
baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. A
 lesson should rarely go over 45 minutes. You may find that a person’s 
schedule or your own time commitments may only allow shorter teaching 
visits. In that case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits 
covering smaller portions of material.</p>
<p data-aid="128201323" id="p7"><span class="page-break" data-page="viii"></span>You
 can teach the lessons in many ways. Which lesson you teach, when you 
teach it, and how much time you give to it are best determined by the 
needs of the person you are teaching and the direction of the Spirit. Do
 not memorize the entire lesson.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201325" id="p8">Effective study during your mission, 
including pondering and listening to the promptings of the Spirit, will 
help you fulfill your purpose as a missionary and strengthen your 
testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Important study opportunities 
include personal study, companion study, district council, zone 
conferences, and mission leadership council (for mission leaders). Your 
missionary schedule includes time for personal and companion study most 
days.</p>
<p data-aid="128201343" id="p9">What you learn in personal study will 
help you in companion study, district council, zone conferences, and 
mission leadership council, where you can “teach one another the 
doctrine of the kingdom” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.77?lang=eng#p77">Doctrine and Covenants 88:77</a>). What you gain from your study opportunities will help you teach with spiritual power.</p>

journal, a notebook, or a binder. Record and organize your thoughts and 
impressions in a way that fits how you learn. Develop your own system to
 easily access key information in the future. Use it often to review, 
access, and apply what you have learned. Use your study journal to take 
notes and record impressions during your personal and companion study, 
district council, zone conferences, mission leadership council, and 
interviews with the mission president.</p>
