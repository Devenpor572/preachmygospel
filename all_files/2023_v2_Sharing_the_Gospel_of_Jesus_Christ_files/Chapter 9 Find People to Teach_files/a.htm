</figure>
<p data-aid="154793350" id="p1">The resurrected Savior told His 
disciples, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in 
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28.19?lang=eng#p19">Matthew 28:19</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/16.15?lang=eng#p15">Mark 16:15</a>). The Lord repeated this commission in our day, saying, “Go ye into all the world [and] preach the gospel” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.8?lang=eng#p8">Doctrine and Covenants 68:8</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.14?lang=eng#p14">50:14</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154793356" id="p2">Missionary work is finding people, 
teaching them, and helping them prepare for baptism. You will fulfill 
the Lord’s commission to teach His gospel and baptize converts as you 
“find them that will receive you” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.8?lang=eng#p8">Doctrine and Covenants 42:8</a>).
 Nothing happens in missionary work until you find someone to teach. 
Watch all the time for opportunities to introduce the gospel. Learn to 
use the ways that are effective in your area.</p>
<p data-aid="154793363" id="p3">It is especially important to work with 
members in finding. Work hard to earn their trust. When members trust 
missionaries, they are more likely to invite their friends and family 
members to meet with you. These people are more likely to be converted 
unto the Lord, be baptized, and progress on the gospel path.</p>
<p data-aid="154793370" id="p4">Finding will happen according to a 
person’s readiness to hear the gospel. The timing will be different for 
each person. Finding can result from a first-time interaction or from 
many interactions over an extended time. Many people have several 
interactions with the missionaries or Church members before beginning a 
serious study of the gospel. Do not hesitate to contact them again.</p>
<p data-aid="154793377" id="p5">Your efforts to find may bear fruit 
after you have been transferred or even after you have finished your 
mission. Regardless of the timing or the outcome, the Lord is grateful 
for your efforts.</p>
<p data-aid="154793384" id="p6">This chapter outlines principles and 
ideas to help you find. These principles are universal. However, 
missionaries and mission leaders may need to adapt them to their 
circumstances.</p>

<h2 data-aid="154793390" id="title3">Exercise Faith to Find People to Teach</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154793396" id="p7">Wherever you serve, the Lord has called you to labor “for the salvation of souls” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.4?lang=eng#p4">Doctrine and Covenants 100:4</a>). To do this, you need to exercise faith in Christ to find people to teach so they can choose to follow Him and be baptized.</p>
<p data-aid="154793402" id="p8">Faith is a principle of action and 
power. Have faith that the Lord is preparing people to receive the 
restored gospel. Have patient confidence that He will lead you to them, 
or them to you. Act on your faith by setting goals, making plans, and 
carrying out your plans to find people to teach (see <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/16-chapter-8?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;8</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154793408" id="p9">Pray with faith as you seek God’s help 
to find people to teach. When Alma led a mission to the Zoramites, he 
prayed: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in 
bringing them again unto thee in Christ. Behold, O Lord, their souls are
 precious&nbsp;…&nbsp;; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and 
wisdom that we may bring [them] again unto thee” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.34-35?lang=eng#p34">Alma 31:34–35</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154793414" id="p10">The people you meet often do not 
realize that they are looking for the restored gospel until they have 
found it. For example, one convert said, “When I heard the gospel, it 
filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t know was there.” Another said, 
“I have finished the search I didn’t know I was on.” Others are actively
 looking for the truth but do not know where to find it (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.12?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 123:12</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154793418" id="p11">Seek the guidance of the Spirit as you 
look for people to teach. Finding by the Spirit is as important as 
teaching by the Spirit. Have faith that you will know how to find those 
who will receive you.</p>

<p data-aid="154793427" id="figure2_p1">There may be members in your 
area who are converts to the Church. Ask how they came in contact with 
the Church. Their answers may give you insights into how to find. Also 
ask how they came to know that the missionaries were teaching them the 
truth. Summarize their experiences in your study journal.</p>

<p data-aid="154793470" id="p13">The right activity, at the right time

<h3 data-aid="154793725" id="title10">Make Finding a Constant Effort</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154793733" id="p22">In the early days of the restored 
Church, the Lord repeatedly instructed a group of brethren to teach His 
gospel “by the way” as they traveled. He wanted them to use every 
opportunity to share the gospel. (See <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/52.9-10,22-23,25-27?lang=eng#p9">Doctrine and Covenants 52:9–10, 22–23, 25–27</a>.)</p>
<p data-aid="154793740" id="p23">Apply this instruction to your finding.
 Make a diligent effort to find throughout the day. Plan your finding 
efforts—and also look for unplanned opportunities. Finding new people to
 teach is a constant need.</p>
<p data-aid="154793747" id="p24">Seek inspiration and be willing to use a variety of ways. Focus on the ways that are most effective in your area.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154793762" id="p25">Concerning the work of missionaries, President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks said:</p>
<p data-aid="154793769" id="p26">“None of us should be like the 
fisherman who thinks he has been fishing all day when in reality he has 
spent most of his time getting to and from the water, eating lunch, and 
fussing with his equipment. Fishing success is related to how long you 
have your line in the water, not to how long you are away from the 
apartment. Some fishermen are away from home for twelve hours and have 
their line in the water for ten hours. Other fishermen are away from 
home for twelve hours and have their line in the water for only two

<p data-aid="154793784" id="p28">Elder Quentin&nbsp;L. Cook expanded on

<h2 data-aid="154793869" id="title13">Talk with Everyone</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796876" id="p34">Develop a deep desire to bring souls to Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28.3?lang=eng#p3">Mosiah 28:3</a>).
 When you feel this desire, your love and concern will be reflected in 
your efforts to find. Your love will also be reflected in your 
conversations.</p>
<p data-aid="154796883" id="p35">Talk with as many people as you can 
each day. Talk with them wherever you go. Where appropriate, go from 
home to home. The Lord instructed some of the early elders of the 
Church, “Open your mouth to declare my gospel.” He then promised that 
their mouths would “be filled” with what to teach (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/30.5?lang=eng#p5">Doctrine and Covenants 30:5</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33.7-10?lang=eng#p7">33:7–10</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154796889" id="p36">Similarly, the Lord told Joseph Smith 
and Sidney Rigdon, “Lift up your voices unto this people; speak the 
thoughts that I shall put into your hearts.” He then promised, “It shall
 be given you … in the very moment, what ye shall say” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.5-6?lang=eng#p5">Doctrine and Covenants 100:5–6</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154796896" id="p37">As you meet people, often you will feel
 the Spirit help you know what to say. However, if you do not feel a 
prompting, just start somewhere—perhaps by asking a question and 
listening to their response (see “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/17-chapter-9?lang=eng&amp;para=title26-figure10_p1#title26">Find People Where They Are</a>” in this chapter). Or perhaps speak of the Lord Jesus Christ or of Joseph Smith’s calling to be a prophet of God.</p>
<p data-aid="154796904" id="p38">The following ideas can help as you talk with those you meet:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154796911" id="p39">Be warm, authentic, and friendly. Look for ways to connect with the person and begin a conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796918" id="p40">Listen sincerely to what people say. Seek to understand each person’s needs and interests. Offer personal help as appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796925" id="p41">Consider how the gospel can help meet 
their needs. Then teach a basic gospel truth and invite them to learn 
more. Share how the restored gospel can bring greater hope and meaning 
into their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796932" id="p42">Ask about their families. Help them see
 how the restored gospel can bless their families. Offer to help them 
find the names of their deceased ancestors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796939" id="p172">Invite them to come to sacrament meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796946" id="p43">Offer pamphlets or other Church materials, both printed and digital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796953" id="p44">Share with them your purpose as a missionary and why you decided to serve a mission.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154796960" id="p45">These principles also apply to your interactions with members.</p>
<p data-aid="154796967" id="p46">It is natural to be somewhat 
apprehensive about talking with people. Pray for faith and courage to 
teach the restored gospel. Everyone you meet is your brother or sister 
in the family of God. Remember that He “denieth none that come unto him,
 black and white, bond and free, male and female; … all are alike unto 
God” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng#p33">2&nbsp;Nephi 26:33</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154797048" id="p48">Build strong relationships with the 
bishopric and other ward leaders. The ward mission leader (if one is 
called) and the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies are your 
primary points of contact. Seek their guidance, and support them in the 
weekly coordination meetings (see <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/21-chapter-13?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;13</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797055" id="p49">During weekly coordination meetings, 
work with the priests quorum assistant and Young Women class president 
for the oldest class. These youth have an important role in sharing the 
gospel. Help them encourage quorum and class members to share the 
gospel. One way is for youth to invite friends to activities.</p>
<p data-aid="154797063" id="p50">Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a 
blessing to local leaders?” Develop an attitude of “How can I help?” 
Like Ammon in the Book of Mormon, approach local leaders with an 
attitude of service (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.23-25?lang=eng#p23">Alma 17:23–25</a>).</p>

Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught: “I hope that you will learn to love the 
local leaders and members. Lift them and inspire them. Your ability to 
link the enthusiasm of the missionaries with the stability and loving 
efforts of the members cannot be overemphasized. Your success will be 
multiplied exponentially” (“Hopes of My Heart,” seminar for new mission 
leaders, June&nbsp;23, 2019).</p>

<h3 data-aid="154797076" id="title18">Support Members in Their Efforts to Share the Gospel</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797082" id="p52">There are many ways to support and 
encourage members in sharing the gospel. Help them reflect on how the 
gospel has blessed their lives. Encourage them to “hold up [their] light
 that it may shine unto the world” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.24?lang=eng#p24">3&nbsp;Nephi 18:24</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797088" id="p53">Help members apply the principles of 
love, share, and invite. Give examples of normal and natural ways they 
can apply these principles.</p>
<p data-aid="154797094" id="p55"><strong>Love.</strong> One way to show 
love for God is by loving and serving His children. Encourage members to
 reach out with love to family members, friends, neighbors, and others. 
Any effort to express love is an important way to keep covenants they 
have made with God (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9-10?lang=eng#p9">Mosiah 18:9–10</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797100" id="p57"><strong>Share.</strong> Because of their love for God and His children, members naturally want to share the blessings He has given them (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13.34-35?lang=eng#p34">John 13:34–35</a>).
 Encourage members to tell others about how the gospel blesses their 
lives. Encourage them to speak of the Savior and His influence. Help 
them feel the joy of sharing their love, time, and life events. Help 
them learn how to share in normal and natural ways—simply as part of 
what they are already doing in their lives.</p>

<p data-aid="154797106" id="p58">“We all share things with others. We do

<p data-aid="154797112" id="p59">“How might we simply add to the list of
 things we already share what we love about the gospel of Jesus Christ? …
 By sharing our positive experiences in the gospel with others, we take 
part in fulfilling the Savior’s great commission” (Gary&nbsp;E. 
Stevenson, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/43stevenson?lang=eng&amp;para=24-25%2C29#p24">Love, Share, Invite</a>,” <cite>Liahona</cite>, May 2022,&nbsp;86).</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-aid="154797118" id="p61"><strong>Invite.</strong> The Savior invites all to receive His gospel and prepare for eternal life (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.33-34?lang=eng#p33">Alma 5:33–34</a>).
 As with sharing, inviting is often a matter of simply including family,
 friends, and neighbors in what members are already doing. Encourage 
members to pray about inviting people in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154797124" id="p62"><strong>Come and see.</strong> Invite people to “come and see” the blessings they can receive through Jesus Christ, His gospel, and His Church.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797130" id="p63"><strong>Come and serve.</strong> Invite people to “come and serve” others in need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797136" id="p64"><strong>Come and belong.</strong> Invite people to “come and belong” as members of the restored Church of Jesus Christ.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154797142" id="p65">Elder Gary&nbsp;E. Stevenson said: 
“There are hundreds of invitations we can extend to others. We can 
invite others to ‘come and see’ a sacrament service, a ward activity, an
 online video that explains the gospel of Jesus Christ. ‘Come and see’ 
can be an invitation to read the Book of Mormon or visit a new temple 
during its open house prior to its dedication. Sometimes the invitation 
is something we extend inward—an invitation to ourselves, giving us 
awareness and vision of opportunities surrounding us to act upon” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/43stevenson?lang=eng&amp;para=33#p33">Love, Share, Invite</a>,”&nbsp;86).</p>
<p data-aid="154797148" id="p66">Be sure to help youth love, share, and 
invite. Youth are especially gifted at loving their friends, sharing 
what is in their heart, and inviting them to activities.</p>
<p data-aid="154797154" id="p67">Help members understand that any effort
 to live the principles of love, share, and invite is positive, whether 
or not a person meets with the missionaries or joins the Church.</p>
<p data-aid="154797161" id="p68">Help members draw on their strengths in
 sharing the gospel. Some are great at finding people to teach, and some
 are great teachers. Some have a natural ability to connect with 
friends, while others love to pray for their friends. Help them see that
 there are ways for everyone to participate.</p>
<p data-aid="154797166" id="p69">When you visit members, do so with a 
purpose. Show that you are anxiously engaged in the work of finding and 
teaching. Respect their time and schedule.</p>
<p data-aid="154797172" id="p70">Some members might welcome having you 
teach a message from one of the lessons. The truths of the gospel are 
life changing. Strengthening members’ understanding of the gospel will 
increase their trust in you and build their excitement to share it. Help
 them recognize the Spirit and act on promptings.</p>
<p data-aid="154797177" id="p71">Seek to find people to teach through 
part-member families, prospective elders, returning members, and new 
members. They will likely have many family members and friends of other 
faiths.</p>
<p data-aid="154797184" id="p72">In all you do with members, follow the Spirit and seek to build their faith in the Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2 data-aid="154797282" id="title21">Find through the Preach My Gospel App</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797288" id="p83">The Preach My Gospel app is a great 
resource for finding people to teach. Missionaries who consistently use 
the features in this app have more success finding. To become acquainted
 with these features, refer to training provided within the app. Be 
sensitive to spiritual promptings you may receive as you review the 
names of people.</p>
<p data-aid="154797294" id="p84">The app includes information about 
people who were previously referred, contacted, or taught. Some of these
 people might want to meet with missionaries again. They might also know
 of other people who may be interested in learning about the gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="154797300" id="p85">In your planning, use the map and 
filters in the app to prioritize which people to visit. Look at their 
information and learn how they were found. See if there is a record 
about members who helped them. Use this information to determine how 
best to reach out to them again.</p>

<p data-aid="154797306" id="p86">Use the filters feature in the app to identify all those who:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154797312" id="p87">Had a previously scheduled baptismal date but were not baptized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797318" id="p88">Attended sacrament meeting at least once but were not baptized.</p>

<li>

<p data-aid="154797329" id="p90">Have not been contacted recently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154797335" id="p91">If people you contact are not 
interested in being taught or choose to stop receiving visits, record 
that information in the app. Record how you will keep in touch with them
 and nurture them until they are ready to learn more. For example, 
consider inviting them to sign up for an email series to receive 
messages about Jesus Christ or other gospel topics. You might also 
connect them with a member who can answer questions and nurture their 
interest and friendship. Set a reminder in the app to follow up with 
them. Ask if they know anyone else who might be interested.</p>
<p data-aid="154797341" id="p92">You can also find people to teach 
through the Preach My Gospel app by using filters or groups to send 
group messages. This can be a great way to let people know about events 
like ward activities and baptismal services. Follow up with personal 
invitations to these events.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154797395" id="p93">People can have positive experiences 
and connect with missionaries and local members at service activities. 
Many people are happy to share their talents, skills, or services and

 activities organized by the ward. You can also connect people with

<h3 data-aid="154797406" id="title25">Offer Service</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797412" id="p95">Like the Savior, “[go] about doing good” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/10.38?lang=eng#p38">Acts 10:38</a>; see also “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/03-chapter-1?lang=eng&amp;para=title37-figure14_p6#title37">Go about Doing Good</a>”
 in chapter&nbsp;1). Pray to be aware of opportunities to do good 
throughout each day. Sometimes your service will be planned, but often 
it will be unplanned. Find simple and immediate ways to serve, help, and
 lift people. Remember that the Lord took unexpected opportunities to 
reach out and bless others.</p>
<p data-aid="154797418" id="p96">Serve with a sincere desire to help 
people. If the service leads to a teaching opportunity, be grateful. If 
not, then be grateful to have done good for someone. Answer questions if
 people ask them. If someone expresses interest, reply briefly and 
arrange to meet at a different time to share a message.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154797436" id="p98">Finding people where they are begins 
with trying to see them as God does. Assume that you may have been led 
to talk with this person, or he or she may have been led to you. Seek to
 understand people’s spiritual needs and desires. Find out what is most 
important to them, especially in their relationships with family and 
God. You might ask questions like those below—and then sincerely listen:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154797442" id="p99">What do you value most?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797447" id="p100">What gives you joy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797452" id="p101">What do you want for your own future and for those you love?</p>

<p data-aid="154797458" id="p102">What challenges do you face in reaching your hopes and dreams?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797464" id="p103">What aspects of your life do you want to improve?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154797470" id="p104">Seek inspiration as you reflect on 
what you learn about the person’s hopes and desires. What gospel truths 
naturally connect with what he or she wants?</p>
<p data-aid="154797476" id="p105">Consider your approach from that 
person’s perspective. What does he or she know about you? What can you 
offer that might be helpful? Does the person feel that an interaction 
with you will be worthwhile?</p>
<p data-aid="154797482" id="p106">Consider different reasons people 
might want to get to know you, other members, or the Church. Some 
examples of what you can provide are outlined below.</p>

<p data-aid="154797622" id="p128">Use the following guidelines when working with people referred to you:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154797626" id="p129">If the person was referred by a member
 or by other missionaries, contact the person who sent the referral to 
learn more. If missionaries referred the person, they may teach with you
 virtually if their mission leader approves. Members may join you in 
person or virtually to participate in teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797630" id="p130">Promptly attempt to contact the person
 through a visit, call, text, email, or other form of communication. If 
the person does not respond, try to contact him or her at a different 
time of day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797634" id="p131">If your initial contact was by call, text, or email, arrange a time to meet in person or through technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797638" id="p132">As a companionship, review the 
person’s request and identify his or her needs and interests. Determine 
how the gospel can help meet those needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797642" id="p133">When you meet, bring any requested 
items, such as the Book of Mormon. Share gospel truths from the 
missionary lessons that meet the person’s interests or needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154797646" id="p134">Sometimes people who are referred can 
lead you to others whom God is preparing. If the people you contact are 
not interested, ask if they know others who might be interested or who 
need hope in their lives. Perhaps you have been led to this person 
because someone else in the home or neighborhood is ready for the 
gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="154797650" id="p135">If an appointment with someone falls 
through, consider how you can do other missionary work in the area. The 
Preach My Gospel app can help you find people nearby who were previously
 contacted or taught.</p>

<h2 data-aid="154797729" id="title36">Use Family History</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797733" id="p148">Family history is another way you can 
find people to teach. Throughout the world, the Spirit is influencing 
millions of people to identify their deceased ancestors. Many want a 
stronger connection with their extended family. This can lead to a 
desire to find a connection and identity as part of God’s family.</p>
<p data-aid="154797737" id="p149">What we sometimes refer to as the 
spirit of Elijah is the influence of the Holy Ghost drawing people to 
identify, document, and cherish their family members—both past and 
present (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/4.5-6?lang=eng#p5">Malachi 4:5–6</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797741" id="p150">In your finding, you might introduce 
people to FamilySearch.org or invite them to download the FamilySearch 
Tree app or the FamilySearch Memories app. You could also give them a 
copy of the booklet <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/myfamily"><cite>My Family: Stories That Bring Us Together</cite></a>. These resources help people discover relatives and ancestors and gather their stories.</p>
<p data-aid="154797746" id="p151">Determine what family history 
resources are available in your area and how they could help the people 
you contact. The ward temple and family history leader can help people 
identify their deceased ancestors.</p>
<p data-aid="154797750" id="p152">Invite people to share memories of 
their loved ones with you. As they do, they may feel the Holy Ghost 
testify to them about the importance of families in God’s plan. These 
moments can lead to natural conversations about the purpose of life, 
God’s plan of happiness, and the role of the Savior in that plan.</p>
<p data-aid="154797754" id="p153">When appropriate, teach people the doctrine about why Church members do family history work and how it relates to temples.</p>
<p data-aid="154797758" id="p154">Pray to be aware of opportunities to 
use family history in your finding efforts. Be creative, and become 
familiar with available resources.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154797821" id="p155">Finding and teaching are related 
activities. People you teach often have friends or relatives who are 
prepared to receive the restored gospel. As the people you teach 
experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will 
increase (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.12?lang=eng#p12">1&nbsp;Nephi 8:12</a>).
 In all situations—such as finding, teaching, and working with 
members—ask, “Who do you know who would benefit from this message?”</p>
<p data-aid="154797824" id="p156">When those you teach are preparing for
 their baptismal service, ask them about family and friends they would 
like to invite to their baptism. Make plans to invite and encourage all 
to come. The Spirit can be powerfully felt during a baptismal service.</p>

<h2 data-aid="154797833" id="title43">Teach When You Find</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797836" id="p157">As you meet people and identify their 
interests and needs, develop the habit of beginning to teach and share 
your testimony. You will find more people to teach as you testify of the
 Savior and His gospel and allow them to feel the power of the Holy 
Ghost.</p>
<p data-aid="154797839" id="p158">Consider teaching on topics such as 
happiness, adversity, the purpose of life, or death. Whatever your 
initial approach, refer quickly and simply to the Savior, His gospel, 
and His call to the Prophet Joseph Smith. This is our unique message to 
the world.</p>
<p data-aid="154797842" id="p159">The following sections provide 
examples of how you might briefly teach about the Restoration of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ and the importance of the family.</p>
<section>
<header>
<h3 data-aid="154797844" id="title44">Teach and Testify about the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797847" id="p160">Testify of Jesus Christ and teach 
brief summaries of restored truth. For example, you can testify of the 
restored gospel of Jesus Christ in just two or three sentences:</p>
<p data-aid="154797849" id="figure16_p1"><i>After centuries of being 
lost, truths have been restored by a loving God through a living 
prophet. We have evidence of this that you can hold in your hands, read,
 and ponder in your heart. We invite you to read and pray to learn its 
truth for yourself. Will you allow us to&nbsp;…</i></p>
<p data-aid="154797851" id="p161">If you have a little more time, you might say more:</p>
<p data-aid="154797853" id="figure17_p1"><i>Our message is simple. God 
is our Father. We are His children. We are part of His family. He knows 
us personally and loves us. He wants us to experience joy. From the 
beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of reaching out in 
love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so His children can know how 
to return to Him. He has revealed the gospel to prophets such as Adam, 
Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But many people repeatedly chose to reject the
 gospel and the prophets who taught it. Two thousand years ago, Jesus 
Christ Himself taught His gospel. People even rejected Jesus. After the 
deaths of Jesus’s Apostles, people distorted true doctrine, such as 
about the Godhead. They also changed ordinances, such as baptism.</i></p>
<p data-aid="154797855" id="figure17_p2"><i>Our invitation to you is to 
add to the truths you already treasure. Consider the evidence that our 
Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love and 
revealed the true doctrine and ordinances to a prophet. This prophet’s 
name is Joseph Smith. The evidence of this truth is found in a book—the 
Book of Mormon. You can hold it in your hands, read it, and ponder its 
truth in your mind and heart. We invite you to attend church to learn 
more.</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<header>
<h3 data-aid="154797857" id="title45">Teach and Testify about the Importance of the Family</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797859" id="p162">Addressing the importance of the 
family will help you find people to teach, whether they have a Christian
 background or a non-Christian one. You can quickly relate what most 
people know about the family to Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. You
 might say something like this:</p>
<p data-aid="154797861" id="p54"><i>Our family can be one of the most 
important influences in our lives. Our family ties us to one another and
 can help us feel needed and loved.</i></p>
<p data-aid="154797863" id="p56"><i>Having a strong, happy family is the
 highest priority for many people. Having a strong marriage and raising 
children in today’s world can be very challenging.</i></p>
<p data-aid="154797865" id="p163">You could then make a transition to the message of the Restoration:</p>
<p data-aid="154797867" id="p170"><i>You have been part of God’s family 
since before you were born. He is our Father. Heavenly Father wants us 
to return to live with Him. You are His child, and He loves you. He has a
 plan to help you return to Him.</i></p>
<p data-aid="154797869" id="p171"><i>These truths and others have been 
restored to the earth by our loving Heavenly Father through a living 
prophet. These truths help us understand our place in God’s family. May 
we teach you more about these truths? Will you attend church so you can 
learn more?</i></p>

about the restored gospel, your efforts are not wasted. Perhaps you have
 planted a seed that will grow at another time. Whether that happens or 
not, your service and expressions of genuine love will bless both you 
and them.</p>
<p data-aid="154797879" id="p165">If people are not ready to receive the
 gospel, see what else you can do to enrich their lives. The 
relationships you develop are still meaningful and valuable. Continue to

Church emails or websites. These messages might help prepare people to 
accept future invitations to learn more.</p>
<p data-aid="154797883" id="p167">When a person does not accept the 
gospel, it is natural to be disappointed. However, as you turn to the 
Lord in such times, He has promised, “I will strengthen thee; yea, I 
will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/41.10?lang=eng#p10">Isaiah 41:10</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797885" id="p168">Through faith in Christ, you can find 
peace and reassurance about your efforts. Maintain a vision of who you 
are and why you are serving the Lord as a missionary. Faith will help 
you press forward and continue in righteous desires.</p>
