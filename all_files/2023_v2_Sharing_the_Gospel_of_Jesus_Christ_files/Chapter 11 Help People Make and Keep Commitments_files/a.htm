<h2 data-aid="154794909" id="title3">Repentance, Commitment, and Conversion</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794918" id="p1">As a missionary and disciple of Jesus Christ, you desire the salvation of souls (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28.3?lang=eng#p3">Mosiah 28:3</a>).
 The Savior is “mighty to save” those who keep the covenants they make 
through receiving essential priesthood ordinances, beginning with 
baptism (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.19?lang=eng#p19">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:19</a>). Extending invitations and helping people keep commitments will prepare them for baptism.</p>
<p data-aid="154794925" id="p2">People are saved on condition of repentance (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.11?lang=eng#p11">Helaman 5:11</a>).
 Repentance is a full and sincere turning to Jesus Christ. Commitment is
 an essential part of repentance. When you invite people to make 
commitments as part of your teaching, you are inviting them to repent.</p>
<p data-aid="154794934" id="p3">Commitment means choosing a course of 
action and following through on that choice. Consistently acting on 
truths of the gospel leads to conversion.</p>
<p data-aid="154794945" id="p4">Conversion is a change in a person’s 
beliefs, heart, and life to accept and follow God’s will. It is a 
conscious decision to become a disciple of Christ. Conversion occurs as 
people exercise faith in Christ, repent of their sins, are baptized, 
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. The Lord and 
His prophets refer to this change as a spiritual rebirth (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3.3-5?lang=eng#p3">John 3:3–5</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.25-26?lang=eng#p25">Mosiah 27:25–26</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154794952" id="p5">The Savior’s Atonement makes conversion possible, and the Holy Ghost brings about this mighty change of heart (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2?lang=eng#p2">Mosiah 5:2</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.12-14?lang=eng#p12">Alma 5:12–14</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154794962" id="p6">Conversion is a process, not an event. 
Helping people become converted to Jesus Christ is central to your 
missionary purpose. As guided by the Spirit, you invite people to make 
commitments that will help them grow spiritually and feel the influence 
of the Holy Ghost in their lives. Then you support people in keeping the
 commitments they have made. You help them act in faith toward lasting 
change (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/6.3?lang=eng#p3">Mosiah 6:3</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154794972" id="p7">People who keep commitments before 
baptism are more likely to make and keep sacred covenants afterward. 
When you teach people to keep commitments, you are teaching them to keep
 covenants. Making and keeping covenants is an essential part of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ and God’s plan for His children.</p>
<p data-aid="154794979" id="p8">This chapter includes guidelines for 
extending invitations, promising blessings, sharing your testimony, and 
helping people keep their commitments so they can come unto the Savior 
and be saved.</p>

<p data-aid="154795000" id="p9">As a representative of Jesus Christ, you
 invite people to follow Him and receive the joy of His gospel. You 
extend specific invitations for them to do things that will build their 
faith in Christ. Then you support them in keeping their commitments.</p>
<p data-aid="154795004" id="p10">Invitations and commitments are vital for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154795014" id="p11">They help people live the principles they learn so they feel the confirming witness of the Spirit.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795027" id="p13">Repentance helps people experience the

<h3 data-aid="154795054" id="title5">Invite as Led by the Spirit</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795062" id="p16">Seek the guidance of the Spirit about 
what invitations to extend and when to extend them. Consider what 
teaching or doctrine, correctly understood, will help a person accept 
your invitation. The right invitation at the right time can prompt 
people to do things that will build their faith. These actions can lead 
to a mighty change of heart (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2?lang=eng#p2">Mosiah 5:2</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.12-14?lang=eng#p12">Alma 5:12–14</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154795069" id="p17">The invitations you extend may be 
small, such as reading a chapter of scripture or coming to sacrament 
meeting. Or they may be as pivotal as being baptized. Invitations should
 be appropriate for where a person is on his or her spiritual journey.</p>
<p data-aid="154795077" id="p18">Spirit-led invitations build on each other to help a person progress spiritually (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p30">2&nbsp;Nephi 28:30</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.12-13?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 93:12–13</a>). Ask yourself, “What commitments is the person keeping? What does he or she need to do next to progress?”</p>
<p data-aid="154795084" id="p19">Listen to those you are talking with or
 teaching. From what you hear and feel, seek the Spirit’s guidance about
 what invitations will help each person progress toward making sacred 
covenants.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154795094" id="title6">Principles for Extending Invitations</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795100" id="p20">Extending invitations requires faith in
 Christ. Have faith that He will bless people when they accept and 
follow through on your invitations.</p>
<p data-aid="154795108" id="p21">People are more likely to change when 
you invite them to act on a truth of the gospel and help them see how 
the change will bless them. They will change to the degree that they 
feel the Spirit and experience the joy of living the gospel of Jesus 
Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="154795115" id="p22">Whenever you engage with people, in 
person or online, consider what invitation could help them strengthen 
their faith in Christ and feel the Spirit. Sometimes this may be as 
simple as meeting with you again or coming to a Church activity.</p>
<p data-aid="154795124" id="p23">As you prepare to teach a lesson, 
consider the needs and progress of each person. Make sure your lesson 
plan includes one or more invitations that will help the person 
progress.</p>
<p data-aid="154795136" id="p24">Be careful not to extend too many invitations at once. A person needs time to act, grow, and learn from each invitation.</p>
<p data-aid="154795143" id="p25">Be bold but not overbearing as you invite people to make commitments (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.12?lang=eng#p12">Alma 38:12</a>). Respect people’s agency.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154795232" id="p26">An invitation often takes the form of a
 “will you” question, which requires a yes or no response. Make your 
invitations kind, specific, and clear. They should invite or lead people
 to make a commitment to act with faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="154795240" id="p27">Although your invitations will be unique for each person, consider the following examples:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154795250" id="p28">Attending church provides a time and 
place for you to worship God and feel His Spirit. It can also help you

<li>
<p data-aid="154795258" id="p29">Now that we have discussed the 
importance of studying the scriptures, will you read [a specific passage

 have? We can discuss your thoughts the next time we meet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795266" id="p30">We have been discussing the life of the
 Savior and His commandments. Will you follow His example by being 
baptized into His Church and making promises with Him? (See “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/04-chapter-3/07-chapter-3-invite?lang=eng">The Invitation to Be Baptized and Confirmed</a>” in chapter&nbsp;3.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795274" id="p31">You expressed interest in connecting

<p data-aid="154795369" id="p34">God promises to bless us as we keep His commandments (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20-21?lang=eng#p20">Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21</a>).
 People who keep the commandments and remain faithful “are blessed in 
all things” and will “dwell with God in a state of never-ending 
happiness” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41?lang=eng#p41">Mosiah 2:41</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154795377" id="p35">As you invite people to make 
commitments, promise them blessings for keeping their commitments. You 
can identify many of these blessings by studying the scriptures, the 
teachings of latter-day prophets, and the lessons in <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/04-chapter-3/06-chapter-3-intro?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;3</a>.
 Think also of the blessings in your own life. Prayerfully decide what 
blessings to promise each person as you extend invitations.</p>
<p data-aid="154795385" id="p36">When inviting a person to live a commandment, teach the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">

<p data-aid="154795438" id="p43">People often face opposition in keeping

<h2 data-aid="154795548" id="title14">Help People Keep Their Commitments</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795556" id="p48">When people accept your invitations to 
do something, follow up to help them keep their commitments. You are 
helping people develop faith in Christ. Your role is to help them 
strengthen their faith and their resolve to progress toward full 
conversion. Do not just invite people to change; support them in doing 
it.</p>
<p data-aid="154795562" id="p49">People will receive a witness of the 
Spirit as they exercise faith unto repentance by keeping commitments. 
That witness often does not come “until after the trial of [their] 
faith” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.6?lang=eng#p6">Ether 12:6</a>).
 Do not be surprised when opposition arises. Plan how you will help them
 through the trial so they receive the witness of the Spirit. Other 
members of the Church can also provide support.</p>
<p data-aid="154795570" id="p50">People often feel the influence of the 
Spirit when you are with them. Emphasize the importance of praying, 
reading the scriptures, and following through on your invitations so 
they will have these feelings when they are on their own.</p>
<p data-aid="154795579" id="p51">Keeping commitments prepares people for
 ordinances and covenants along the path of lifelong conversion. Your 
efforts can help them “manifest by their works” their desire to follow 
Jesus Christ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154795595" id="p52">Helping people keep commitments begins 
when you first visit and teach them. Ask them to record their commitment
 on their phone, calendar, or something you leave with them.</p>
<p data-aid="154795603" id="p53">Ask if you, or a member who has been 
participating, can make a brief daily contact between teaching visits. 
Explain that the purpose of these contacts is to support them, and 
describe some ways you can do that. These contacts are one way to apply 
the principle in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.106?lang=eng#p106">Doctrine and Covenants 84:106</a>.</p>
<p data-aid="154795611" id="p54">Determine the method of contact that 
would be most effective, such as a brief visit, phone call, text, or 
social media message. Technology offers many options for additional 
reminders and support.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154795619" id="title16">Encourage and Help People in Your Daily Contact</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795627" id="p55">For every invitation you extend, record
 notes in the Preach My Gospel app about how to follow up the next day. 
As you plan the next day, seek the guidance of the Spirit as you discuss
 how to help people keep their commitments.</p>
<p data-aid="154795634" id="p56">Make your daily contacts with people 
positive and encouraging. Pray for them. Show love and understanding as 
you help them keep their commitments. Answer questions and help them 
overcome challenges. If there is time, read together from the Book of 
Mormon. Share relevant Church media, including music produced by the 
Church that might lift them. Be respectful of their time and wishes.</p>
<p data-aid="154795641" id="p57">Introduce them to other Church members. When appropriate, ask members to help people keep their commitments (see <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/18-chapter-10?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;10</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154795648" id="p58">Compliment people who are working to 
keep their commitments. Help them see how the Lord is pleased with their
 efforts. These people are changing their lives, which takes a lot of 
work and patience. Help them recognize the blessings they are receiving.
 Express confidence that they can succeed.</p>
<p data-aid="154795656" id="p59">Also show love if people have not kept 
their commitments. Offer to support them during your daily contact. For 
example, if someone accepted an invitation to read a chapter in the Book
 of Mormon but has not done it yet, offer to read it together. Help the 
person discover by experience how keeping commitments can bless his or 
her life.</p>
<p data-aid="154795665" id="p60">It might take many tries for people to 
keep a commitment, and you might need to make several visits to help 
them. Discuss how they can overcome challenges to keeping commitments. 
Be patient and supportive, not critical or judgmental.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154795680" id="p61">When you follow up with people, ask 
them to share their experience with keeping commitments. Ask what they 
have learned and felt. This will help them recognize the Spirit’s 
influence in their lives and help them identify the next step.</p>
<p data-aid="154795687" id="p62">As you contact people each day, an 
important part of your purpose is to invite the influence of the Holy 
Ghost into their lives. Help them recognize how to feel the Spirit when 
you are not present. Your daily contact should strengthen the spiritual 
feelings they felt when you taught them. They will be converted as they 
feel the power and influence of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154795693" id="title18">Show Love</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795700" id="p63">The process of conversion is centered in Christlike love (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.15?lang=eng#p15">4&nbsp;Nephi 1:15</a>).
 Seek the gift of charity. Showing sincere love can help people feel the
 Spirit in their lives. Your expressions of love can also help them 
accept invitations and keep commitments that lead to conversion.</p>
<p data-aid="154795708" id="p64">As you love and teach others, your own conversion to the Savior will deepen.</p>
<p data-aid="154795717" id="p65">Assisting with the conversion of 
another person is a sacred work. You will find lasting joy as you devote
 yourself to this work and to serving others (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/10.39?lang=eng#p39">Matthew 10:39</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17?lang=eng#p17">Mosiah 2:17</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27.17-18?lang=eng#p17">Alma 27:17–18</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10-16?lang=eng#p10">Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–16</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154795754" id="p66">Missionary work has its greatest effect
 as people make and keep the commitment to live the gospel and stay 
active in the Church throughout their lives. It is not enough for them 
to simply come into the Church. The Lord desires that they come to stay 
(see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/15.16?lang=eng#p16">John 15:16</a>).
 Direct all your teaching and invitations toward that end. To receive 
all the blessings that Heavenly Father has for them, members must 
continue to live the gospel by keeping the commandments and the 
covenants they have made as they stay active in the Church.</p>
<p data-aid="154795762" id="p67">Nephi taught: “After ye have gotten 
into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I 
say unto you, Nay; … ye must press forward with a steadfastness in 
Christ, … and [if ye] endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: 
Ye shall have eternal life” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.19-20?lang=eng#p19">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:19–20</a>).</p>
