</header>
<p data-aid="154794065" id="p2">Jesus Christ “is the life and the light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.9?lang=eng#p9">Alma 38:9</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1?lang=eng">John&nbsp;1</a>). Studying the word of God in the holy scriptures will bring abundance to your life (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10.10?lang=eng#p10">John 10:10</a>).
 His words will fill you—and those you teach—with light and truth. They 
will help you—and those you teach—live righteously and receive divine 
protection and strength. They will help you come to know Him and taste 
His love, which is sweet above all that is sweet. His words will fill 
your soul with joy (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.11-12?lang=eng#p11">1&nbsp;Nephi 8:11–12</a>; see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.1-34?lang=eng#p1">verses&nbsp;1–34</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154794068" id="p3">The scriptures are a heavenly gift. One 
of the great blessings of your mission is having a scheduled time to 
study them every day.</p>
<p data-aid="154794071" id="p4">Gospel study is one of the most 
rewarding kinds of spiritual work you can do. It is invigorating both 
mentally and spiritually. As Alma taught, when you “plant” the word of 
God in your heart, it will “enlighten [your] understanding” and become 
delicious to you (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#p28">Alma 32:28</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.3-4?lang=eng#p3">Enos 1:3–4</a>). As you continue to study and apply God’s word, it will “take root; and … be a tree springing up unto everlasting life” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.41?lang=eng#p41">Alma 32:41</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.42-43?lang=eng#p42">verses&nbsp;42–43</a>). Your knowledge and testimony of the gospel will increase. Your desire and ability to share the gospel will also increase.</p>
<p data-aid="154794075" id="p5">Learning from a good teacher is 
important, but it is also important for you to have meaningful learning 
experiences from your own study of the scriptures. This is also true for
 the people you teach.</p>
<p data-aid="154794076" id="p6">Understanding the scriptures may be 
challenging at first. However, as you patiently persist in studying the 
word of God, your understanding will grow. You will come to treasure 
your time with the scriptures. You will eagerly look forward to what you
 will learn and experience.</p>
<p data-aid="154794082" id="p7">Coming to know and love the scriptures 
can be a great lifelong blessing of your missionary service. As you 
experience the blessings of scripture study during your mission, you 
will want to continue for the rest of your life.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154794134" id="p9">Learning the gospel is much more than 
gaining information. It is also a spiritual process of applying eternal 
truth under the guidance of the Holy Ghost (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.8?lang=eng#p8">Jacob 4:8</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.19-25?lang=eng#p19">Doctrine and Covenants 50:19–25</a>).
 Seek and trust the Spirit to teach you as you study the scriptures. 
This will happen to the degree that you liken the scriptures to yourself
 with real intent to act on what you learn (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23?lang=eng#p23">1&nbsp;Nephi 19:23</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4?lang=eng#p4">Moroni 10:4</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.18?lang=eng#p18">Joseph Smith—History 1:18</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154794138" id="p10">Prayerfully studying the scriptures 
will open a window of revelation for the Spirit to speak to your mind 
and heart. He will bless you with guidance, inspiration, and answers to 
your questions. Through your study of the scriptures, the Holy Ghost 
will strengthen and comfort you. He will give you knowledge and 
conviction that will bless your life and enable you to bless others 
eternally.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154794356" id="p24">The four safeguards outlined below will
 help you use technology appropriately. Following these safeguards is an
 important way for you to “put on the whole armour of God, that ye may 
be able to stand against the wiles of the devil” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/6.11?lang=eng#p11">Ephesians 6:11</a>).</p>

<h3 data-aid="154794363" id="title9">Be in Tune with Spiritual Promptings</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794369" id="p25">Nephi promised, “If ye will enter in by
 the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things 
what ye should do” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.5?lang=eng#p5">2&nbsp;Nephi 32:5</a>).
 Your Heavenly Father has given you two powerful gifts that will help 
you: moral agency and the gift of the Holy Ghost. You have the power to 
choose to follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost. His guidance is vital 
in helping you do good while using technology. It also helps protect you
 from evil.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154794379" id="title10">Be Focused on Your Missionary Purpose</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794399" id="p26">The Lord said, “If your eye be single 
to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there 
shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light 
comprehendeth all things” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.67?lang=eng#p67">Doctrine and Covenants 88:67</a>).
 To have your eye single to the glory of God means having your focus 
completely on God’s purpose, which is also your purpose as a missionary.</p>
<p data-aid="154794406" id="p27">Your use of technology should be 
centered on your purpose. Turn on your device only after you have 
identified the missionary purpose for which you will use it. Then turn 
it off when that purpose is completed.</p>
<p data-aid="154794411" id="p28">You are more likely to encounter 
inappropriate content on the internet when you are casually surfing the 
web without a specific purpose in mind.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154794418" id="title11">Be Disciplined</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794424" id="p29">Mormon wrote: “I am a disciple of Jesus
 Christ, the Son of God. I have been called of him to declare his word 
among his people, that they might have everlasting life” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5.13?lang=eng#p13">3&nbsp;Nephi 5:13</a>).
 Like Mormon, you are a disciple of Christ. Serving as a full-time 
missionary is a special opportunity to deepen your discipleship.</p>
<p data-aid="154794430" id="p30">The words <i>disciple</i> and <i>discipline</i>
 come from the same root word that means “learner” or “pupil.” To be a 
disciple of Christ means that you seek to follow Him and keep His 
commandments. It means that you consistently learn and teach of Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="154794437" id="p31">Be disciplined and make righteous 
choices in how you use technology. Choose to follow the safeguards. When
 you are talking face-to-face with people, do not check messages or 
answer calls. Take control of how you use these devices. Do not let them
 control you.</p>
<p data-aid="154794448" id="p32">The Lord declared, “He that receiveth 
my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he 
receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/41.5?lang=eng#p5">Doctrine and Covenants 41:5</a>). While no one is perfect, the Lord expects consistent, persistent effort to follow Him.</p>
<p data-aid="154794453" id="p33">The beauty of the gospel is that we can be forgiven as we repent—and the Lord wants us to repent without delay (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.21?lang=eng#p21">Doctrine and Covenants 109:21</a>).
 If you make a mistake, including inappropriate use of technology, 
repent in that moment and keep trying to live His law. This is part of 
being a disciple of Christ.</p>

<header>
<h3 data-aid="154794460" id="title12">Be One</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794465" id="p34">The Lord said, “Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27?lang=eng#p27">Doctrine and Covenants 38:27</a>).
 Help your mission develop a culture of unity, trust, accountability, 
and compassion so you can strengthen and support one another.</p>
<p data-aid="154794472" id="p35">All missionaries should feel 
comfortable asking for help when needed. A missionary who is strong in 
the Spirit can help one who is feeling weak (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.106?lang=eng#p106">Doctrine and Covenants 84:106</a>). If you feel tempted, ask your companion or mission leader for help.</p>
<p data-aid="154794478" id="p36">Nearly all challenges associated with 
the internet or with pornography happen in isolation. Use devices only 
when you can see each other’s screens. Have courage and be accountable 
to each other.</p>
<p data-aid="154794483" id="p37">The Lord has confidence in each 
missionary He has called, including you. He has provided companions and 
leaders to help protect and support you. Just as Alma supported his 
companion Amulek, seek to strengthen each other (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/15.18?lang=eng#p18">Alma 15:18</a>).</p>

<h3 data-aid="154794490" id="title13">What Should You Do If You Feel Vulnerable or Susceptible?</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794496" id="p38">Learning to follow these four 
safeguards requires effort, discipline, and practice. Even after the 
safeguards become a natural part of how you think and act, you will have
 times when you may feel vulnerable or susceptible. Perhaps you had some
 poor technology habits before your mission that have been difficult to 
overcome. Some missionaries struggled with pornography before their call
 and may be tempted to fall back into former patterns of behavior.</p>
<p data-aid="154794498" id="p39">The principles below will help you live the safeguards and fortify yourself against temptation:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154794511" id="p40">Be aware of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Understand how they can make you more vulnerable to misusing technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794517" id="p41">Choose to act. Respond in righteous, productive ways to what you are feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794523" id="p42">Learn, repent, and improve. Use your experiences to continue learning and improving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154794529" id="p43">You do not have to overcome challenges 
on your own. Rely on the strength that comes through the Savior’s 
Atonement and the covenants you have made with Him. The Lord knows the 
challenges you face, and He will help you in this great work.</p>
<p data-aid="154794535" id="p44">Always remembering the Savior can help 
you use technology righteously. Be true to the trust He has given you. 
Determine to “walk uprightly before him” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.21?lang=eng#p21">Alma 53:21</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.20?lang=eng#p20">verse&nbsp;20</a>).
 Feeling gratitude for all that He and the Father have done for you will
 help you make good choices about how you use digital resources.</p>
<p data-aid="154794541" id="p45">Your mission is a great opportunity to 
learn to use technology wisely. The commitment and good habits you 
develop during your mission will benefit you for the rest of your life.</p>

<p data-aid="154794562" id="p47">By putting on the “whole armour of 
God,” you will be able to discern truth from error. You will have your 
feet shod with the “gospel of peace.” Putting “on the breastplate of 
righteousness” will protect you. With the “shield of faith,” you will be
 able to quench the fiery darts of the adversary. You will take “the 
sword of [His] Spirit” to teach truth with power and authority. You will
 be fortified against worldly influences that could otherwise lead you
