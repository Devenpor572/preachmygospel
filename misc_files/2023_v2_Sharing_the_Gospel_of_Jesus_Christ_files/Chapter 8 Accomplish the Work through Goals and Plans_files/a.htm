efforts to help God’s children progress spiritually. It then presents a 
simple goal-setting process you can use in all aspects of missionary 
work, including your personal and companionship goals. It also outlines 
how to conduct weekly and daily planning sessions with your companion.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154794441" id="p6">Perhaps you have wondered which of your 
many missionary duties are the most important. This is a good question 
to consider as you set goals and plan each week and each day. To help 
answer it, think about your purpose as a missionary:</p>
<p data-aid="154794449" id="p7">“Invite others to come unto Christ by 
helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ 
and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, and enduring to the end.”</p>
<p data-aid="154794456" id="p8">Let your missionary purpose guide your 
goals and plans. Focus on how you can help individuals exercise their 
agency to become converted to the Savior and receive His gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="154794461" id="p9">Seek the guidance of the Spirit and 
counsel with your companion as you set goals and make plans. Then follow
 through with your plans and use your time effectively.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154794628" id="p26">During weekly planning, you and your 
companion set goals for all the key indicators. Your key indicator goals
 should reflect your desire to help more people experience the blessings
 of conversion.</p>
<p data-aid="154794643" id="p27">Set goals and make plans to do things in your control that can influence key indicator outcomes. For example:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154794652" id="p28">You might set a key indicator goal to 
begin teaching a specific number of new people during the week. Whether 
you reach that goal depends on other people’s agency. But do what is in 
your control to accomplish it. One way is to set a goal to talk with a 
certain number of new people each day. Then plan how you will do that. 
See the ideas in <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/16-chapter-8?lang=eng&amp;para=title_number3-p222#title_number3">Appendix&nbsp;2</a> of this chapter and in <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/17-chapter-9?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;9</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794666" id="p29">You might set key indicator goals to 
have a specific number of new members and people you are teaching attend
 sacrament meeting. Whether they come or not depends on their agency. 
But do what is in your control to influence these key indicator 
outcomes. Plan when to invite them and how to follow up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794675" id="p30">You might set a key indicator goal to 
have members participate in a specific number of lessons during the 
week. Whether you reach that goal depends on the members and the people 
you are teaching. But do what you can to influence this key indicator 
outcome. Set a goal to work with ward leaders to have members present. 
Then plan how you will coordinate their participation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154794683" id="p31">As a companionship, you set the key 
indicator goals for your own area. Base them on (1)&nbsp;the progress of
 those you are teaching and (2)&nbsp;the need to find new people to 
teach. Finding new people to teach is a constant need.</p>
<p data-aid="154794692" id="p32">Mission-wide key indicator goals are based on the goals set by each companionship.</p>
<p data-aid="154794699" id="p33">The Preach My Gospel app will help you 
stay focused on people as you set key indicator goals. This app will 
also help you learn from past goals and show your progress toward 
current goals.</p>
<p data-aid="154794708" id="p34">Key indicator goals and results are 
automatically reported to your mission leaders and young missionary 
leaders through the Preach My Gospel app.</p>
<p data-aid="154794716" id="p35">Be careful not to emphasize one key 
indicator goal over the others. An ongoing focus on all key indicators 
will help you consistently invite others to come unto Christ and make 
covenants.</p>

<p data-aid="154794757" id="p39">Teach the gospel in ways that meet

<p data-aid="154794773" id="p41">Remember that key indicators are not 
the end goal. Instead, they represent a person’s potential spiritual 
progress toward baptism, confirmation, and enduring conversion. People’s
 actual progress will depend on their choices. You support their 
progress by exercising faith in Christ on their behalf as you set goals,
 plan, act diligently, and minister to them in an inspired way.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154795002" id="p63">Weekly planning helps you see the big 
picture and focus on people. It also helps you focus on activities that 
are most important. Daily planning helps you adapt and prepare to take 
specific actions each day. You want to be productive, not just busy.</p>
<p data-aid="154795009" id="p64">During planning sessions, ask yourself 
basic questions about what you feel the Lord would have you do. Seek 
inspiration to answer these questions in ways that are appropriate for 
each situation and person. The answers should then take shape in your 
plans.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154795276" id="p92">Concerning those who were baptized in 
his day, Moroni said, “Their names were taken, that they might be 
remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the 
right way” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4?lang=eng#p4">Moroni 6:4</a>). Keeping good records is one way you can apply this principle.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154795284" id="title15">Record Your Efforts</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795293" id="p93">Keeping records is part of diligently 
watching over your area with love and concern. Keep your records 
accurate and up to date. This will help you remember what you need to do
 to help people.</p>
<p data-aid="154795301" id="p94">The Preach My Gospel app allows you to 
coordinate and share important information with local leaders and 
members on the progress of people and the work.</p>

<p data-aid="154795317" id="p95">Follow data retention and privacy 
guidelines when recording goals and plans in the Preach My Gospel app 
and in printed tools.

<h2 data-aid="154795354" id="title17">Accountability</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795362" id="p100">The principle of accountability is fundamental in God’s eternal plan (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.15-19?lang=eng#p15">Alma 5:15–19</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.13?lang=eng#p13">Doctrine and Covenants 104:13</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.9?lang=eng#p9">137:9</a>).
 This principle influences how you think and feel about the sacred 
responsibility the Lord has given you. Accountability also influences 
how you approach your work.</p>
<p data-aid="154795372" id="p101">During His earthly ministry, the 
Savior gave assignments to His disciples to help them grow, develop, and
 accomplish His work. He also gave them opportunities to account for the
 work they were given to do (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/9.10?lang=eng#p10">Luke 9:10</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/23.6-13?lang=eng#p6">3&nbsp;Nephi 23:6–13</a>). As a missionary, you likewise account for the work the Lord has given you to do.</p>
<p data-aid="154795379" id="p102">Approach your goal setting and 
planning with the idea that you will account to the Lord through prayer 
each day. Also be accountable to yourself and to your mission leaders.</p>
<p data-aid="154795388" id="p103">Rendering an account should be a 
loving, positive experience in which your efforts are recognized and you
 identify ways you can improve.</p>
