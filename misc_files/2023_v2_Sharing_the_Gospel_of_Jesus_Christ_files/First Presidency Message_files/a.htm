<p class="salutation" data-aid="154794034" id="p1">Dear Fellow Missionary:</p>
</div>
<p data-aid="154794036" id="p2">We congratulate you on the great 
opportunity you have to be a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. There is no more compelling or important work than
 the gathering of Israel.</p>
<p data-aid="154794037" id="p3"><cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> is 
intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature 
missionary. It is also intended to help you be a more effective teacher.
 We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion study. We 
also encourage you to use it in your district council meetings and zone 
conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrine and 
principles.</p>
<p data-aid="154794040" id="p4">We invite you to rise to a new sense of 
commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every 
missionary has an important role in helping the Lord in His work “to 
bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#p39">Moses 1:39</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154794042" id="p5">The Lord will bless you as you humbly 
dedicate yourself to serving Him. May you find great joy and happiness 
as you labor among Heavenly Father’s children.</p>
