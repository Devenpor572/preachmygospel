<div class="body-block">
<p data-aid="154794073" id="p1">The lessons in this chapter contain the 
essential doctrine, principles, and commandments of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. These lessons are what the living prophets and apostles have 
instructed you to learn and teach. They are provided here so you can 
help others clearly understand the doctrine of Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="154794077" id="p2">The first section in this chapter is the baptismal invitation. The rest of the chapter consists of the following four lessons:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154794094" id="p7">Study the scriptures and treasure up the
 doctrine in each lesson. As you do, the Spirit will bear witness of the
 truths you study. He will help you know what to say and do to help 
others receive a witness of the truth. (See <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85?lang=eng#p85">Doctrine and Covenants 84:85</a>.)</p>
<p data-aid="154794098" id="p8">People will come to know the Savior more
 fully as they do what He has invited them to do. Extend invitations in 
each lesson, and help people keep their commitments. As people keep 
commitments, they begin to live the gospel of Jesus Christ and prepare 
to make covenants with God.</p>
<p data-aid="154794102" id="p9">Teach all the lessons before and after 
baptism. Full-time missionaries take the lead in teaching the lessons 
both times. Ward missionaries or other members participate when 
possible.

<header>
<h2 data-aid="154794105" id="title2">Prepare to Teach</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794109" id="p10">As you prepare to teach, review the 
information for each person in the Preach My Gospel app. Make a lesson 
plan based on the person’s needs. Consider what he or she should know 
and feel during your teaching visit. The Spirit will magnify your 
efforts as you take time to prepare and plan.</p>
<p data-aid="154794114" id="p11">Here are some questions for you and your companion to prayerfully consider as you prepare to teach.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154794119" id="p12"><strong>What invitation will we extend to help the person build faith in Christ and make progress?</strong> Invitations are how you help people repent and experience “the power of the Redeemer” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.11?lang=eng#p11">Helaman 5:11</a>). Consider the person’s progress, situation, and needs. Then include one or more invitations in your lesson plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794125" id="p13"><strong>What doctrine and principles will help the person keep the commitment we have invited him or her to make?</strong>
 Prayerfully determine what doctrine and principles will help people 
understand why keeping their commitment is important for them and to the
 Lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794128" id="p14"><strong>How will we help the person learn the doctrine?</strong> To prepare to teach the doctrine, organize and summarize what you will teach using <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/04-chapter-3/08-chapter-3-lesson-1?lang=eng">lessons&nbsp;1–4</a>. Identify questions, scriptures, examples, and appropriate media that will help the person understand what you teach. See <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/18-chapter-10?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;10</a> for information about how to improve your teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794133" id="p15"><strong>What blessings has God promised for accepting and keeping commitments?</strong> As you study the doctrine, identify God’s promised blessings. As you teach, promise blessings and bear testimony of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794139" id="p16"><strong>Which members could participate?</strong>
 In the weekly coordination meeting, determine which members could help 
you teach and support the person. Before the lesson, discuss their 
participation. See <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/18-chapter-10?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;10</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794149" id="p17"><strong>What can we do to help people keep their commitments after we leave?</strong>
 Follow up by making a brief daily contact to help people keep their 
commitments. Look for ways to include members in helping those you teach
 keep their commitments. This contact could include reading a chapter 
from the Book of Mormon or other scriptures. If someone is not keeping a
 previous commitment, it may be better to help with that before 
extending another one. See <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/19-chapter-11?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;11</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154794155" id="p18"><strong>How can we better help them next time?</strong>
 After every teaching situation, evaluate the experience of the people 
you are teaching. Is their faith in Christ growing? Are they feeling the
 Spirit? Are they repenting and making and keeping commitments? Are they
 praying, studying the Book of Mormon, and attending church? Make plans 
to help them.</p>
</li>

<h2 data-aid="154794160" id="title3">Teach from Your Heart as Guided by the Spirit</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794168" id="p19">Speaking to all elders and sisters, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles stated:</p>
<p data-aid="154794176" id="p20">“Our purpose is to teach the message of
 the restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both
 the missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the 
concepts of the [lessons], but these should not be taught by rote 
presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as 
prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but 
speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of 
the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the 
interest and needs of the [person]. Speaking out of his own conviction 
and in his own words, he should bear testimony of the truth of his 
teachings.”</p>

<p class="title" data-aid="154794183" id="aside1_title1">The Role of Memorization</p>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794192" id="aside1_p1">Commit to memory the sequence of the teachings in each lesson. Do not memorize lessons word for word.</p>
<p data-aid="154794198" id="aside1_p2">If you are learning a second 
language, focus your language study on preparing to teach the lessons. 
Memorize vocabulary, phrases, sentence patterns, and brief statements of
 doctrine as they appear in the lessons. Memorizing the outlines in <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/04-chapter-3/08-chapter-3-lesson-1?lang=eng">lessons 1–3</a> can also be helpful. What you memorize should become personally meaningful to you.</p>
<p data-aid="154794205" id="aside1_p3">Consider memorizing key doctrinal
 scriptures to use in your teaching and your personal life. Great power 
can come from memorizing scriptures. These scriptures can strengthen you
 and give you inspiration and comfort. They can prompt you to change. 
When you memorize scriptures, the Spirit can bring them to your mind 
when you need them.</p>

<h2 data-aid="154794213" id="title5">Teach and Invite according to Individual Needs</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154794222" id="p21">You have the flexibility to teach the 
lessons in whatever way helps people fully prepare for baptism and 
confirmation. Which lesson you teach, when you teach it, and how much 
time you give to it are best determined by the needs of the person you 
are teaching and the guidance of the Spirit. For example, when teaching 
people who do not have a Christian background, you might begin by 
helping them develop a greater connection with Heavenly Father and an 
understanding of His plan (see “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/18-chapter-10?lang=eng&amp;para=title63-aside3_p25#title63">Teaching People Who Do Not Have a Christian Background</a>” in chapter&nbsp;10).</p>
<p data-aid="154794229" id="p22">Let the Spirit guide you in what 
invitations to extend and when to extend them. The right invitation at 
the right time can prompt people to do things that will build their 
faith. These actions can lead to a mighty change of heart (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2?lang=eng#p2">Mosiah 5:2</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.12-14?lang=eng#p12">Alma 5:12–14</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154794237" id="p23">Teach lessons that are simple, clear, 
and brief. Typically, a teaching visit should not be longer than 
30&nbsp;minutes, and you can teach a person in as few as 5&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p data-aid="154794246" id="p24">You will usually need multiple meetings
 to teach the principles in one lesson. People will often better 
understand your message if you teach short lessons, teach frequently, 
and teach small portions of material.</p>
