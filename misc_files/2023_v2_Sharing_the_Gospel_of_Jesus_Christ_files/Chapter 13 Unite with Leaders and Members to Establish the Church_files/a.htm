Show that you are anxiously engaged in the work of finding and teaching.
 Respect their time and schedule.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154796980" id="p42">Each ward or branch has unique needs 
for you to adapt to. You may serve in a small branch or a young single 
adult ward, or you may serve multiple wards. Some leaders will have more
 experience and some less. Some leaders will have more time available 
than others.</p>
<p data-aid="154796986" id="p43">Look for ways to help local leaders. 
They might ask you to help support members in their ministering 
assignments. They might ask you to encourage new members to invite their
 friends to attend church. You can provide valuable insights about 
missionary work as leaders and members learn ways to share the gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="154796993" id="p44">Where the Church is relatively new, 
branch leaders might ask you to help new members understand how the Lord
 has organized His Church.</p>
<p data-aid="154797000" id="p45">Your work with leaders may be different
 in different areas, but all these activities are essential to blessing 
individuals and establishing the Lord’s Church.</p>

continue attending sacrament meeting and partaking of the sacrament when
 they have friends in the ward. Help them feel a sense of belonging,

<p data-aid="154797245" id="p60">Local leaders might ask you to help 
returning members build their faith. Often these assignments will be

 concerns.</p>
<p data-aid="154797251" id="p61">As circumstances allow, teach the

 their desire to make and keep covenants.</p>
