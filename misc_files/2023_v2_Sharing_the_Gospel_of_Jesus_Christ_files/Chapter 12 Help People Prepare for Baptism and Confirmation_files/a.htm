<p data-aid="154793502" id="p1">Baptism is a joyous ordinance of hope 
that brings the power of God into a person’s life. That power comes 
through receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. It will continue as a 
person endures to the end in keeping the baptismal covenant.</p>
<p data-aid="154793510" id="p2">The purpose of your teaching is to help 
others develop their faith in Jesus Christ, repent of their sins, and be
 baptized with a sincere desire to follow Christ. As Mormon taught, “the
 first fruits of repentance is baptism” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.25?lang=eng#p25">Moroni 8:25</a>).
 As the people you teach keep the commitments you invite them to make, 
they will be prepared to make and keep covenants with God and enjoy the 
promised blessings.</p>
<p data-aid="154793517" id="p3">Baptism and confirmation are not a final
 destination. Rather, these ordinances are the gate by which God’s 
children enter the covenant path. This path leads to the ordinances, 
covenants, and joyous blessings of the temple—and ultimately to eternal 
life (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.20-40?lang=eng#p20">3&nbsp;Nephi 11:20–40</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154797073" id="p70">The person who conducts the interview 
discerns that the child understands the baptismal covenant. He should 
feel confident that the child will strive to keep this covenant by 
obeying the commandments, including attending Church meetings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p data-aid="154797079" id="p71"><strong>Do I need consent of the spouse to baptize a husband or wife?</strong> Yes. A married person must have the consent of his or her spouse before being baptized.</p>
<p data-aid="154797085" id="p73"><strong>If a parent in a family is not ready for baptism, should I baptize other family members or wait until the parent is ready?</strong>
 It is preferable that family members be baptized together. However, if 
some are not ready, individual family members may be baptized as long as
 any necessary consent is given.</p>
<p data-aid="154797091" id="p75"><strong>Should baptisms of family 
members be delayed until the father can receive the Aaronic Priesthood 
and perform the baptisms himself?</strong> No. Newly baptized brethren 
do not receive the Aaronic Priesthood on the day they are baptized. They
 first need to be interviewed by the bishop and sustained by ward 
members.</p>
<p data-aid="154797097" id="p77"><strong>May I teach and baptize a person who resigned Church membership or whose membership was withdrawn?</strong>
 People who resigned Church membership or whose membership was withdrawn
 may be readmitted by baptism and confirmation. If they would like to be
 taught, counsel with local priesthood leaders and your mission 
president about any role you might have.</p>
<p data-aid="154797103" id="p79">In a stake, readmission by baptism is 
under the direction of the bishop or stake president. In a mission, 
readmission is under the direction of the mission president. These 
leaders will receive guidance from the First Presidency as needed. 
Missionaries do not conduct these baptismal interviews or fill out the 
Baptism and Confirmation Form. However, a missionary may be invited to 
perform the baptism.</p>
<p data-aid="154797109" id="p80">Former members of the Church who rejoin
 are not converts. Nevertheless, missionaries can sometimes have an 
important role in helping them enjoy the blessings of Church membership 
again.</p>
<p data-aid="154797115" id="p81"><strong>What if a person has a scheduled baptismal date but is not keeping all the commitments?</strong> Wait to schedule a baptismal interview until the person is keeping the commitments and meets the baptism qualifications. See “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/20-chapter-12?lang=eng&amp;para=title8-p66#title8">When a Baptism Needs to Be Postponed</a>” in this chapter.</p>
<p data-aid="154797121" id="p83"><strong>What if a couple want to be baptized but are living together?</strong>
 A couple living together outside of a legal marriage between a man and a
 woman may not be baptized until they live the law of chastity. This 
means no longer living together—whether as a heterosexual couple or a 
same-sex couple—or, for a man and a woman, it means getting married. It 
also includes exercising faith unto repentance as described in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>. Marriage between a man and a woman is an essential part of God’s plan.</p>
<p data-aid="154797127" id="p85"><strong>Questions&nbsp;5 and&nbsp;6 in 
the baptismal interview ask if a person has ever committed a serious 
crime or participated in an abortion. What should I do if someone 
answers “yes” to either of these questions?</strong> If you become aware
 of one of these situations during a baptismal interview, do not ask 
about the details. Do not promise that the person will be approved for 
baptism. Instead, express your love and kindly explain that someone with
 more maturity and experience will talk with the person and help.</p>
<p data-aid="154797133" id="p87">Send a baptismal interview request to your mission president. He or one of his counselors will meet with the person. See <cite>General Handbook</cite>, <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&amp;para=title_number267-p2794#title_number267">38.2.8.7</a> and <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&amp;para=title_number268-p2798#title_number268">38.2.8.8</a>.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154797187" id="p90">The baptismal service and confirmation 
should be spiritual highlights for a new member. The baptismal service 
should be scheduled as soon as a person has met the qualifications for 
baptism. Explain what is planned and why. Discuss proper dress, 
including how the person will be given white clothing to wear for the 
baptism.</p>
<p data-aid="154797193" id="p91">Baptismal services for converts are 
planned under the bishopric’s guidance. The ward mission leader (if one 
is called) or the member of the elders quorum presidency who leads 
missionary work plans and conducts these services. He coordinates with 
the full-time missionaries. Baptismal services should be simple, brief, 
and spiritually uplifting.</p>
<p data-aid="154797199" id="p92">Invite a member of the bishopric, a 
member of the Relief Society presidency, and a member of the elders 
quorum presidency (if he is not conducting) to attend the baptismal 
service. When appropriate, invite other organization leaders, youth 
leaders, and ministering brothers and sisters (if assigned). Work with 
the person being baptized to invite friends and relatives to attend the 
baptismal service and the confirmation.</p>
<p data-aid="154797205" id="p93">Consider inviting other people you are 
teaching. These experiences will help them feel the Spirit and learn 
more about the gospel. After the service, follow up to discuss their 
experience and invite them to be taught.</p>

<h2 data-aid="154797280" id="title12">Confirmation</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797286" id="p106">A person receives the ordinance of confirmation after he or she has been baptized (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.41?lang=eng#p41">Doctrine and Covenants 20:41</a>).
 A new convert is considered a member of the Church after the ordinances
 of baptism and confirmation are both completed and properly recorded.</p>
<p data-aid="154797291" id="p107">Confirmations are under the direction of the bishop. However, he does not conduct a separate interview for confirmation.</p>
<p data-aid="154797297" id="p108">Work closely with the bishop and the 
ward mission leader (if one is called) to make sure that new converts 
are confirmed. The confirmation should occur as soon as reasonable after
 baptism, preferably the next Sunday. However, the bishop can allow the 
confirmation to take place at the baptismal service as an exception (see
 <cite>General Handbook</cite>, <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng&amp;para=title_number23-p106#title_number23">18.8</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797303" id="p109">Converts are typically confirmed in a 
sacrament meeting in the ward where they live. The bishop typically 
invites missionary elders serving in the ward to participate in the 
confirmation. If a missionary performs the confirmation, he also needs 
approval from the mission president (see <cite>General Handbook</cite>, <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng&amp;para=title_number24-p95#title_number24">18.8.1</a>). At least one member of the bishopric participates.</p>

<h2 data-aid="154797309" id="title13">Complete the Baptism and Confirmation Form</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797315" id="p110">It is vital that a membership record 
is promptly created after a person is baptized and confirmed. Concerning
 such records in his day, Moroni wrote that new members “were numbered 
among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, 
that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to 
keep them in the right way” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4?lang=eng#p4">Moroni 6:4</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797321" id="p111">As you teach someone who is preparing 
to be baptized, begin to fill out the Baptism and Confirmation Form in 
the Preach My Gospel app. Explain that this form will be used to create a
 membership record. This record will contain important information about
 the ordinances the person receives. When Church members move, their 
membership record is forwarded to their new ward so local leaders and 
members can support them.</p>
<p data-aid="154797327" id="p112">As soon as the new member is baptized 
and confirmed, update the form with information about each ordinance, 
including who performed it. When you have completed the form, record the
 information in the Preach My Gospel app and submit it to the ward clerk
 electronically. As soon as the clerk has received the form, he reviews 
it and creates a membership record.</p>
<p data-aid="154797333" id="p113">After the membership record is 
created, a clerk prepares a Baptism and Confirmation Certificate. This 
certificate is signed by the bishop and given to the person.</p>
<p data-aid="154797340" id="p114">The name and sex on the membership 
record and certificate should match the person’s birth certificate, 
civil birth registry, or current legal name.</p>

explained why gospel standards are important. Discuss the following 
counsel. How can you encourage people to desire to meet these standards?</p>
<!--<img alt="Elder Gerrit W. Gong" class="headshot" id="aside2_img1" data-src="2131220" />-->
<p data-aid="154797495" id="aside2_p4">“The Lord sets His standards so 
that He can bless us. Think about those blessings: He promises those who
 meet the standards the help of the Holy Ghost. He promises personal 
peace. He promises the chance to receive holy ordinances in His house. 
And He promises those who endure in living His standards that they will 
have eternal life.&nbsp;…</p>
<p data-aid="154797499" id="aside2_p5">“Because we love the people we 
serve, all of us want to do better in lifting our Heavenly Father’s 
children to the faithfulness and purity they need to have all the 
blessings of the Lord.&nbsp;…</p>
<p data-aid="154797504" id="aside2_p6">“…&nbsp;You begin by holding up 
the Lord’s standards clearly and without apology. And the more the world
 drifts from them and mocks them, the bolder we must be in doing that”
