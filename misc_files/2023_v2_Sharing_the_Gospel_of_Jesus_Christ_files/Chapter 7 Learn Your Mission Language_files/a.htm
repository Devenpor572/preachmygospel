</header>
<p data-aid="154793352" id="p8">Learning to teach effectively in your 
mission language requires diligent effort and the gifts of the Spirit. 
Do not be surprised if the task seems hard. It takes time. Be patient 
with yourself. As you dedicate yourself to learning the language, you 
will acquire the skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a 
missionary.</p>
<p data-aid="154793360" id="p9">You are not alone in learning your 
mission language. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will help you as you 
seek Their help. Seek and be open to the help of your companion, 
members, those you teach, other missionaries, and other people.</p>
<p data-aid="154793367" id="p10">Listen carefully and speak the language
 at every opportunity. Do not be afraid to make mistakes. Everyone who 
learns a new language makes mistakes. People will understand, and they 
will appreciate your efforts to learn their language.</p>
<p data-aid="154793374" id="p11">Keep improving your language skills 
until the end of your mission. As your ability to speak the language 
grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you say it. 
You will be less worried about how to communicate and better able to 
respond to the needs of others.</p>

<h2 data-aid="154793480" id="title12">Create a Language Study Plan</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154793487" id="p22">A language study plan helps both new 
and experienced missionaries focus on what they can do each day to 
improve their ability to speak their mission language. Your plan will 
include what you will do during your language study time and throughout 
the day.</p>
<p data-aid="154793494" id="p23">The following steps show how you can 
create a language study plan by using the goal-setting process from 
chapter&nbsp;8. Adapt this process as needed.</p>
<ol class="decimal" start="1">
<li data-marker="1.">
<p data-aid="154793501" id="p24"><i>Prayerfully set goals and make plans.</i>
 Set weekly and daily goals to improve your general ability to 
communicate and teach the gospel. Include things that you want to commit
 to memory, such as words, phrases, scriptures, and passages.</p>
</li>
<li data-marker="2.">
<p data-aid="154793508" id="p25"><i>Record and schedule.</i> Decide 
which language tools will help you achieve your goals. Language tools 
could include the scriptures, dictionaries, grammar books, the TALL 
Embark app, and others. Schedule times when you will formally study and 
use the language. For example, you might schedule to read aloud from the
 Book of Mormon for 15&nbsp;minutes each day during lunch.</p>
</li>
<li data-marker="3.">
<p data-aid="154793515" id="p26"><i>Act on your plans.</i> The Lord 
loves effort, so work diligently to accomplish your goals. Protect your 
language study time and reschedule it for later if conflicts arise.</p>
</li>
<li data-marker="4.">
<p data-aid="154793522" id="p27"><i>Review and follow up.</i> Review 
your study plan often to evaluate how well it is working. Invite your 
companion, mission leaders, members, and others in your area to suggest 
ways you can improve. Participate in regularly scheduled language 
assessments to chart your progress and identify ways to improve.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p data-aid="154793529" id="p28">Balance your language study between 
long-term goals for creating a language foundation and short-term goals 
for specific activities and people you are teaching.</p>
<p data-aid="154793536" id="p29">During your formal language study time,
 balance your goals and plans across the basic areas of language shown 
below. Decide what you will learn throughout the day.</p>

<p data-aid="154793592" id="figure2_p1">Take time each week to evaluate your language study by asking the following questions:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154793599" id="figure2_p2">Did I study my mission language each day this week? What can I do to consistently improve my mission language?</p>

<h2 data-aid="154793649" id="title14">Learn with Your Companions</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154793656" id="p36">Help your companions experience success
 and gain confidence in learning the mission language or in learning 
English. Sincerely and frequently compliment your companions and other 
missionaries on their progress.</p>
<p data-aid="154793663" id="p37">Provide simple and practical feedback 
with kindness. Give them many opportunities to teach and testify 
successfully. Note how a more experienced missionary helped his 
companion in the following true account.</p>
<p data-aid="154793670" id="figure3_p1"><i>I had just arrived in my 
second area when my companion told me it was my turn to give the 
spiritual thought at a dinner appointment. My first companion had always
 been happy to do the teaching, and I was used to giving my small 
portion of the lesson and then listening.</i></p>
<p data-aid="154793677" id="figure3_p2"><i>I tried to convince my 
companion that he should give the spiritual thought, but he encouraged 
me to take the assignment. I practiced with his help.</i></p>
<p data-aid="154793684" id="figure3_p3"><i>When the moment arrived, I opened my scriptures and read from <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5?lang=eng">3&nbsp;Nephi 5</a> and&nbsp;<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng">7</a>.
 I struggled but managed to explain why I felt my chosen passages were 
significant, and I was relieved when I was done. When a question was 
asked, I looked to my companion to answer, but he didn’t open his mouth.
 That was when I amazed myself by coming up with an answer in 
understandable French. I was even more amazed that the member didn’t 
seem to sense that I was insecure about my communication skills. I 
gained confidence and realized that my French was better than I gave 
myself credit for.</i></p>
<p data-aid="154793691" id="figure3_p4"><i>The weeks passed, and my 
companion continued to let me teach—even when I didn’t think I could do 
it and even though he probably wondered if I could do it. I felt that I 
had become a tool of our Father in Heaven instead of simply being a 
quiet companion.</i></p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154793732" id="p38">Culture and language are closely 
related. Understanding the culture of the people will help explain the 
way language is used. This understanding will also help you communicate 
the unique aspects of the message of the Restoration in a way that will 
be clear to people.</p>
<p data-aid="154793739" id="p39">One of the greatest things you can do 
to gain people’s trust and love is to respect and embrace their culture 
in appropriate ways. Many great missionaries have done this (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/9.20-23?lang=eng#p20">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:20–23</a>).</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154793760" id="figure5_p2">Think about the cultural and 
religious background of the people you teach. Identify an aspect of 
their background that might make it hard for them to understand a 
principle of the gospel. Plan ways to teach this principle clearly.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154793774" id="p40">Gifts of the Spirit are real. The gift 
of tongues and the interpretation of tongues have many manifestations. 
Some of these include speaking, understanding, and interpreting 
languages. Today the gift of tongues is most often manifested in 
Spirit-enhanced learning and studying to help missionaries learn the 
language in their mission.</p>
<p data-aid="154793781" id="p41">The Holy Ghost can manifest the truth 
of your testimony even though a language barrier may exist between you 
and those you teach. Likewise, the Holy Ghost can bring words and 
phrases to your remembrance and help you understand what people are 
saying from their hearts.</p>
<p data-aid="154793788" id="p42">For the most part, you will not obtain these gifts without effort. You need to actively seek them to bless others (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.8-9,26?lang=eng#p8">Doctrine and Covenants 46:8–9,&nbsp;26</a>).
 Part of seeking the gift of tongues is to labor and do all you can to 
learn the language. Be patient as you prayerfully study and practice the
 language. Trust that the Spirit will help you as you make a diligent 
effort. Have faith that you can have the gift of tongues help you and 
those you teach.</p>
<p data-aid="154793795" id="p43">When you struggle to express yourself 
as clearly as you would like, remember that the Spirit is able to speak 
to the hearts of God’s children. President Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson taught:</p>
<p data-aid="154793802" id="p44">“There is one language … that is common
 to each missionary—the language of the Spirit. It is not learned from 
textbooks written by men of letters, nor is it acquired through reading 
and memorization. The language of the Spirit comes to him who seeks with
 all his heart to know God and keep His divine commandments. Proficiency
 in this language permits one to breach barriers, overcome obstacles, 
and touch the human heart” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1997/06/the-spirit-giveth-life?lang=eng&amp;para=6#p6">The Spirit Giveth Life</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite>, June 1997,&nbsp;2).</p>

your pronunciation and help you improve. Ask him or her to take note of 
situations when you are not understood. Make a list of words, phrases, 
or grammar that would help. Explain and practice how to use what is on 
the list in upcoming activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796950" id="aside2_p6">Practice actively listening. Plan
 a time during the day to listen actively to identify vocabulary and 
patterns you have learned. When you hear a phrase expressed differently 
from the way you would say it, write it down and practice it.</p>
