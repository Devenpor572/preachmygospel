</header>
<p data-aid="154794772" id="p4">During His earthly ministry, Jesus “went about … teaching …&nbsp;, preaching …&nbsp;, and healing” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4.23?lang=eng#p23">Matthew 4:23</a>).
 He taught in many settings—in synagogues, in homes, and on the road. He
 taught in large gatherings and in private conversations. Some of His 
most powerful interactions were very brief or in unusual settings. He 
taught through His actions as well as His words.</p>
<p data-aid="154794781" id="p5">The Savior taught each person according 
to his or her unique needs. For example, when serving a paralyzed man, 
He forgave his sins and healed him (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/2.1-12?lang=eng#p1">Mark 2:1–12</a>). When ministering to a woman who had committed adultery, He protected her and invited her to sin no more (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8.2-11?lang=eng#p2">John 8:2–11</a>).
 When speaking with a rich man who desired eternal life, He “loved him” 
despite the young man’s refusal to accept His invitation to follow Him (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.21?lang=eng#p21">Mark 10:21</a>; see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.17-21?lang=eng#p17">verses&nbsp;17–21</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154794790" id="p6">You can improve your teaching by 
learning how the Savior taught. For example, He loved the Father and 
those He taught. He was prayerful. He taught from the scriptures. He 
prepared spiritually. He asked inspired questions. He invited people to 
act in faith. He likened gospel principles to everyday life.</p>
<p data-aid="154794799" id="p7">Seeking to teach as the Savior taught is a lifelong pursuit. It will come to you line upon line as you follow Him (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p30">2&nbsp;Nephi 28:30</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.41?lang=eng#p41">Ether 12:41</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154794817" id="p8">To teach the gospel of Jesus Christ, you
 need to know its basic doctrine and principles. You also need spiritual
 knowledge and confirmation of gospel truths. The Lord said, “Seek not 
to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word.”</p>
<p data-aid="154794826" id="p9">To “obtain” the Lord’s word means to 
study it and let it sink deep in your heart. As you make this effort, He
 promised, “Then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you 
shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the 
convincing of men” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.21?lang=eng#p21">Doctrine and Covenants 11:21</a>).</p>

 Treasuring up the Lord’s words will increase your knowledge and 
strengthen your testimony. Your desire and ability to teach the gospel 
will likewise increase. (See <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.6-7?lang=eng#p6">Jacob 4:6–7</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27-42?lang=eng#p27">Alma 32:27–42</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.26?lang=eng#p26">36:26</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.8-9?lang=eng#p8">37:8–9</a>.)</p>
<p data-aid="154794846" id="p11">Prayerfully obtain and treasure up the Lord’s word by studying the scriptures, the words of living prophets, and the lessons in <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/04-chapter-3/06-chapter-3-intro?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;3</a>.</p>

<p data-aid="154794862" id="p12">The gospel of Jesus Christ is “the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/1.16?lang=eng#p16">Romans 1:16</a>). For that reason, the message of the Restoration of the gospel needs to be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p data-aid="154794871" id="p13">It is important that you develop 
teaching skills. It is also important that you learn the doctrine and 
principles you teach. However, when teaching spiritual truths, you do 
not rely primarily on your own abilities and knowledge.</p>
<p data-aid="154794880" id="p14">Spiritual truths are taught by the 
power of the Holy Ghost. The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given 
unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye

</header>
<p data-aid="154794899" id="p15">When you teach by the Spirit, you pray 
to have the power of the Holy Ghost in your teaching. You also pray that
 people will receive truths by the Spirit. People may be persuaded of 
some truths, but to be converted, they need to have experiences with the
 Spirit (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2-3?lang=eng#p2">Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154794905" id="p16">Prepare yourself to be an instrument through whom the Spirit can teach. Think of the Holy Ghost as your companion in teaching.</p>
<p data-aid="154794915" id="p17">Rely on the Spirit to help you know 
what to say. He will bring the doctrine you have studied to your 
remembrance. He will help you plan and adjust what you teach according 
to a person’s needs.</p>
<p data-aid="154794924" id="p18">When you teach by the Spirit, He will 
carry your message unto people’s hearts. He will confirm your message 
when you bear your testimony. You and those who receive what you teach 
by the Spirit will be edified, understand one another, and rejoice 
together.

<p data-aid="154795093" id="p35">Before teaching a lesson, give a simple
 overview of what you will teach. Help people see how it will have 
relevance to them. For example, you might say, “We are here to share the
 message that Jesus Christ has established His Church on the earth today
 and has called living prophets to guide us.” Or you might say, “We are 
here to help you know that God loves you and has a plan for your 
happiness.”</p>
<p data-aid="154795101" id="p36">All people will benefit as they accept 
and live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father may have blessed 
the people you find with valuable spiritual preparation (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/16.16-17?lang=eng#p16">Alma 16:16–17</a>).</p>

<h2 data-aid="154795134" id="title10">Use the Scriptures</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795139" id="p38">The standard works of the Church are 
your basic sources for teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. 
There are many reasons why it is vital to use the scriptures as the 
basis for your teaching. For example:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154795150" id="p39">The scriptures invite the Holy Ghost into your teaching (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/24.13-32?lang=eng#p13">Luke 24:13–32</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795158" id="p40">The scriptures have a more powerful effect on the minds of people than anything else (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.5?lang=eng#p5">Alma 31:5</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795165" id="p41">The scriptures address the great questions of the soul (see <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/13-chapter-5?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;5</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3?lang=eng#p3">2&nbsp;Nephi 32:3</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.8?lang=eng#p8">Jacob 2:8</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795172" id="p42">The scriptures give authority and validity to your teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795178" id="p43">The Lord and His prophets have said to do so (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.12,56-58?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 42:12, 56–58</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/71.1?lang=eng#p1">71:1</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154795189" id="p44">By using the scriptures in your 
teaching, you can help others begin to study the scriptures on their 
own. As your love for the scriptures is evident, they will be encouraged
 to study. Show how studying the scriptures will help them learn the 
gospel and feel God’s love. Give examples of how the scriptures can help
 them find answers to their questions and receive guidance and strength.</p>
<p data-aid="154795196" id="p45">Devote yourself to studying the scriptures so you can teach from them effectively (see <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/04-chapter-2?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;2</a>). Your ability to teach from the scriptures will improve as you study them every day, both personally and with your companion.</p>
<p data-aid="154795205" id="p46">Help people develop faith in Jesus 
Christ through studying the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon.
 The following suggestions may help.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154795213" id="title11">Introduce the Scripture</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795220" id="p47">Briefly describe the background of the passage. The following examples show some ways to introduce a scripture:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154795229" id="p48">“In Joseph Smith’s history, Joseph 
tells us in his own words what happened as he went into the grove to 
pray. He said, ‘I saw a pillar of light&nbsp;…’”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795237" id="p49">“In this passage, the prophet Alma is 
teaching people who are poor to exercise their faith in the word of God.
 He compares the word of God to a seed that can be planted in our 
hearts. Will you begin reading verse&nbsp;…&nbsp;?”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<header>
<h3 data-aid="154795246" id="title12">Read the Passage</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795256" id="p50">Read the verses aloud or ask the person
 you are teaching to read aloud. Be sensitive to those who struggle to 
read. If a passage is difficult for them to understand, read with them 
and explain as needed. Define any difficult words or phrases. Or give 
them a simpler passage to read. Invite them to look for particular 
points in the passage.</p>
</section>
<section>
<header>
<h3 data-aid="154795264" id="title13">Apply the Scriptures</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795273" id="p51">Nephi said, “I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23?lang=eng#p23">1&nbsp;Nephi 19:23</a>). To “liken” means to apply the scriptures to your life.</p>
<p data-aid="154795281" id="p52">Liken the scriptures to those you teach by showing how the stories and principles are relevant to them personally. For example:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154795289" id="p53">“Like you, the people of Alma had heavy
 burdens, almost more than they could bear. But as they exercised faith 
and prayed, God strengthened them so they could endure the challenges. 
Then He delivered them from their trials. Just as He did with these 
people, I know God will help you in your trials as you&nbsp;…” (See <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng">Mosiah&nbsp;24</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795297" id="p54">“Alma’s instruction to the people at the Waters of Mormon applies to us today. John, are you willing to&nbsp;…&nbsp;?” (See <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng">Mosiah&nbsp;18</a>.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154795305" id="p55">Teach people how to “liken” the 
scriptures on their own. Discovering personal applications will help 
them apply and experience the power of the word of God.</p>
</section>
<section>
<header>
<h3 data-aid="154795313" id="title14">Invite and Help People to Read on Their Own</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795321" id="p56">The people you teach need to read the 
scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon, to gain a testimony of the 
truth. By effectively using the scriptures in your teaching, you can 
help people begin to study the scriptures on their own.</p>
<p data-aid="154795328" id="p57">After each visit, suggest specific 
chapters or verses for them to read. Suggest questions for them to 
consider as they read. Encourage them to study the scriptures daily on 
their own and with their families. You might also ask members to read 
with them between lessons.</p>
<p data-aid="154795336" id="p58">Before beginning the next lesson, 
follow up by discussing what you invited people to read. As needed, help
 them understand and “liken” these scriptures. Encourage them to record 
their thoughts and questions.</p>
<p data-aid="154795344" id="p59">When you help people read, understand, 
and apply the scriptures—especially the Book of Mormon—they will have 
spiritual experiences with the word of God. They will be more likely to 
read on their own and make the scriptures an important part of their 
lives.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154795367" id="p61">Ask people which language they would like to read or listen to the scriptures in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795375" id="p62">Those who struggle to read, or who 
struggle to understand what they read, may benefit from reading aloud 
together or listening to audio recordings. These are available through 
free Church apps and websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795383" id="p63">If a person has a digital device, help 
him or her access the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon. The 
Book of Mormon app and Gospel Library are free and easy to share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154795393" id="p64">If using text, chat, or email, send

<h2 data-aid="154795522" id="title18">Share Your Testimony</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795530" id="p66">A testimony is a spiritual witness 
given by the Holy Ghost. To share your testimony is to give a simple, 
direct declaration of knowledge or belief about a gospel truth. Sharing 
your testimony adds your personal witness to the truths you have taught 
from the scriptures.</p>
<p data-aid="154795538" id="p67">Sharing your testimony is a powerful 
way to invite the Spirit and help others feel His influence. One of the 
missions of the Holy Ghost is to testify of Heavenly Father and Jesus 
Christ. He often fulfills this in companionship with you as you bear 
testimony.</p>
<p data-aid="154795546" id="p68">A powerful testimony does not depend on
 eloquence or the volume of your voice—but on the conviction and 
sincerity of your heart. Be careful not to rush or dramatize your 
testimony. Give people a chance to feel the Holy Ghost bear witness to 
them that what you have taught is true.</p>
<p data-aid="154795554" id="p69">Your testimony may be as simple as 
“Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer” or “I have learned for myself 
that the Book of Mormon is true.” You could also share a brief 
experience about how you gained this testimony.</p>
<p data-aid="154795563" id="p70">When you teach, share your testimony as
 you feel prompted, not just at the end. When your companion is 
teaching, share your testimony to provide a second witness of what he or
 she has taught.</p>
<p data-aid="154795571" id="p71">Share your testimony that the principle
 you are teaching will bless the person’s life if he or she will follow 
it. Tell how living the principle has blessed your life. Your sincere 
testimony will help create an environment for people to feel the Holy 
Ghost confirm truth.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154795825" id="title23">Allow Time for People to Apply What They Are Learning</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795832" id="p88">When you teach, allow time for people to apply what they are learning (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.2-3?lang=eng#p2">3&nbsp;Nephi 17:2–3</a>).
 Look for appropriate ways to support them in keeping their commitments.
 Focus on helping them with actions that will build a foundation of 
faith, such as praying, reading, and attending church. This will enable 
them to keep additional commitments.</p>
<p data-aid="154795837" id="p89">As you plan and teach, be sensitive 
about how much new information you share. A primary objective of your 
teaching is to help a person build faith in Jesus Christ so it leads to 
repentance. Your objective is not to see how much information you can 
dispense.</p>
<p data-aid="154795843" id="p90">Teach at a pace that is appropriate for
 the person. Ask questions and listen carefully so you understand how 
well he or she is learning and applying what you are teaching.</p>
<p data-aid="154795848" id="p91">The truths you teach, coupled with the 
power of the Holy Ghost, can influence people to exercise their agency 
in ways that build their faith in Christ. As they exercise faith in the 
Lord by applying what they learn, they will come to know by the Spirit 
that the gospel is true.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154795855" id="title24">Use a Variety of Teaching Opportunities</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795861" id="p92">Teaching opportunities take many forms, such as in-person visits, video chats, phone calls, text messages, and social media.</p>
</section>

<h3 data-aid="154795867" id="title25">Respect People’s Time</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795873" id="p93">Keep your teaching simple and brief. 
People are more likely to meet with you when you respect their time and 
requests. Ask how much time they have for the visit. Start and end any 
conversation at the agreed time, whether teaching in person or online. 
Be aware that in some places, phone calls or video chats can be 
expensive.</p>
<p data-aid="154795878" id="p94">You will need multiple meetings to 
teach the principles in one lesson. Typically a teaching visit should 
not be longer than 30&nbsp;minutes, and you can teach a person in as few
 as 5&nbsp;minutes. Adjust your teaching according to people’s time.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154795884" id="title26">Use Technology Wisely</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154795889" id="p95">You have many opportunities to teach 
people using technology. Some people prefer the convenience or privacy 
of interacting through electronic means. Even people you visit in person
 can benefit from additional support through technology. Discuss the 
resources available to communicate. Then follow up and stay connected. 
Allow each person’s preferences to guide your interactions.</p>
<p data-aid="154795895" id="p96">Technology such as video calls can be 
especially helpful for teaching people who have busy schedules or live 
far away. Sometimes it is easier for members to participate in a lesson 
via technology.</p>

<p data-aid="154795909" id="p97">During the Savior’s ministry, He told 
His disciples, “Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid 
them not: for of such is the kingdom of God” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.14?lang=eng#p14">Mark 10:14</a>).
 When you teach children, adjust your approach and message to meet their
 needs. Help them learn the gospel by discussing things that are 
familiar to them. Ensure that they understand what you are teaching.</p>

<p data-aid="154795999" id="p105">Members’ primary role in lessons is to
 offer sincere testimony, share brief personal experiences, and develop a
 relationship with those being taught. You might ask members to share 
how they were able to learn, accept, and live a particular principle in 
the lesson. If they are converts, invite them to share how they decided 
to join the Church.</p>
<p data-aid="154796004" id="p106">When members refer someone, ask them 
to participate in the teaching. Members may be more involved in these 
situations. Counsel with them about how they would like to participate.</p>
<p data-aid="154796006" id="p107">Consider how using technology to teach
 with members might be appropriate. Technology allows members to join 
you without the time commitment that an in-person visit requires.</p>
<p data-aid="154796011" id="p108">In the weekly coordination meeting, plan with ward leaders to have a member participate in as many lessons as possible (see <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-2023/21-chapter-13?lang=eng">chapter&nbsp;13</a>).

<h3 data-aid="154796355" id="title44">Listen with Genuine Caring</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796357" id="p142">Listening takes effort and genuine 
caring. While others talk, make sure you are concentrating on what they 
are saying. Avoid the tendency to be planning what you will say.</p>
<p data-aid="154796358" id="p143">Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland taught: 
“More important than speaking is listening. These people are not 
lifeless objects disguised as a baptismal statistic.&nbsp;… Ask these 
friends what matters most to <em>them</em>. What do <em>they</em> cherish, and what do <em>they</em>
 hold dear? And then listen. If the setting is right you might ask what 
their fears are, what they yearn for, or what they feel is missing in 
their lives. I promise you that <em>something</em> in what they say will <em>always</em>
 highlight a truth of the gospel about which you can bear testimony and 
about which you can then offer more.&nbsp;… If we listen with love, we 
won’t need to wonder what to say. It will be given to us—by the Spirit 
and by our friends” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me?lang=eng&amp;para=19#p19">Witnesses unto Me</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite>, May 2001,&nbsp;15).</p>

<h3 data-aid="154796360" id="title45">Observe Unspoken Messages</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796362" id="p144">People also communicate through their 
body language. Notice the way they sit, their facial expressions, what 
they do with their hands, their tone of voice, and where they are 
looking. Observing these unspoken messages can help you understand the 
feelings of those you teach.</p>
<p data-aid="154796364" id="p145">Also be aware of your own body language. Send a message of interest and enthusiasm by listening sincerely.</p>

<header>
<h3 data-aid="154796366" id="title46">Allow People Time to Think and Respond</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796368" id="p146">The Savior often asked questions that 
required time for a person to respond. When you ask a question, pause to
 give the person a chance to think and respond. Do not be afraid of 
silence. People often need time to think about and reply to questions or
 to express what they are feeling.</p>
<p data-aid="154796370" id="p147">You might pause after asking a 
question, after sharing a spiritual experience, or when people are 
having difficulty expressing themselves. Be sure to give them time to 
complete their thoughts before you respond. Do not interrupt while they 
are talking.</p>
</section>
<section>
<header>
<h3 data-aid="154796372" id="title47">Respond with Empathy</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796374" id="p148">When a person answers a question, 
begin your response by expressing empathy if appropriate. Empathy shows 
that you genuinely care. Refrain from jumping to conclusions, 
immediately offering solutions, or appearing to have all the answers.</p>
</section>
<section>
<header>
<h3 data-aid="154796376" id="title48">Confirm That You Understand What People Say</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796378" id="p149">When seeking to understand what a 
person is saying, ask to make sure you understand. For example, you 
might ask, “So what you are saying is <span class="input" data-scale="100"></span>. Is that right?” or “If I understand correctly, you are feeling that <span class="input" data-scale="100"></span>.” When you are not sure if you understand, ask the person for clarification.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154796380" id="title49">Navigate Challenging Interactions</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796382" id="p150">You will help people most by teaching 
them the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some people may want to do most of the 
talking. Sometimes people simply need someone to listen compassionately 
to their struggles and feelings. Other people may seek to dominate or 
argue.</p>
<p data-aid="154796384" id="p151">Learn to manage such situations 
tactfully and with love. You may be able to adapt your teaching to 
address something a person shared. Or you may need to politely say that 
you would like to discuss their concern at another time. The Spirit can 
help you know how to respond in challenging situations.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154796386" id="title50">Help People Feel Comfortable Sharing True Feelings</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796388" id="p152">To avoid embarrassment, some people 
will answer questions the way they think you want them to answer rather 
than share their true feelings. Seek to develop a relationship that 
allows them to be comfortable sharing their true feelings with you.</p>
<p data-aid="154796390" id="p153">Understanding and connecting with 
people will allow you to help them, meet their interests and needs, and 
express the Savior’s love to them. Create a relationship of trust by 
being honest with them, maintaining an appropriate missionary 
relationship, and showing respect.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154796408" id="p154">Make an earnest effort to address 
people’s questions and help them resolve their concerns. However, it is 
not your responsibility to answer every question. Ultimately, people 
must resolve their questions and concerns for themselves.</p>
<p data-aid="154796409" id="p155">Realize that not all questions and 
concerns can be completely answered. Some answers become clearer with 
time. Others have not yet been revealed. Focus on building a firm 
foundation of the basic, essential truths of the gospel. This foundation
 will help you and those you teach press forward with patience and faith
 when there are unanswered or difficult questions.</p>
<p data-aid="154796410" id="p156">Some principles for answering questions are outlined in this section.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154796411" id="title53">Understand the Concern</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796412" id="p157">Some of what you teach people might 
seem difficult or unfamiliar to them. If people have questions or 
concerns, first seek to understand them clearly. Sometimes people’s 
concerns are like an iceberg. Only a small part is visible above the 
surface. These concerns can be complex. Pray for the gift of 
discernment, and follow the Spirit in how you respond. Heavenly Father 
knows the hearts and experiences of all people (the complete iceberg). 
He will help you know what is best for each person.</p>
<p data-aid="154796413" id="p158">Often concerns are more social than 
doctrinal. For example, some people might fear opposition from family 
members if they join the Church. Or they might fear rejection from their
 friends at work.</p>
<p data-aid="154796414" id="p159">Seek to understand the source of the 
concern by asking questions and listening. Did the concern arise because
 the person does not have a spiritual confirmation of the truth of the 
Restoration? Did it arise because the person does not want to commit to 
living a gospel principle? Knowing the root of their concern will help 
you know whether to focus on testimony or commitment.</p>

<p data-aid="154796416" id="p160">Show people how the truths in the scriptures can help answer their questions and address their concerns.

applying the scriptures, they will increase their capacity to hear and

will come testimony, repentance, and the ordinance of baptism.</p>

<p data-aid="154796418" id="p162">It can be helpful to explain that much
 of our understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ comes from what has 
been revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith and those who succeeded him. 
Questions about the truthfulness of the gospel can be resolved by 
gaining a testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. Reading and 
praying about the Book of Mormon is a vital way to gain this testimony.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154796443" id="p172">You can help people who are struggling
 to overcome addiction by lovingly discussing their struggles, 
supporting them, and connecting them with resources. You might encourage
 them to attend one of the Church’s addiction recovery support groups. 
These groups may meet in person or online. (See <a href="https://addictionrecovery.churchofjesuschrist.org/"><span class="language" lang="eng">AddictionRecovery.ChurchofJesusChrist.org</span></a>.) Encourage them to use the resources in the “<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/life-help/addiction">Addiction</a>” section of Life Help in the Gospel Library.</p>
<p data-aid="154796444" id="p173">Local Church leaders and members can 
also provide support. Some people with addictions may need professional 
medical and mental health treatment.</p>
<p data-aid="154796445" id="p174">Here are a few suggestions for how you can support people struggling to overcome addiction:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154796446" id="p175">Reinforce their efforts to come unto 
Christ. Help them see that their efforts to recover and heal are 
recognized and valued by Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Teach them 
that they can be strengthened through the Savior and His Atonement. He 
fully recognizes the intent of their heart to do good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796447" id="p176">Pray for them in your personal 
prayers, and pray with them. As appropriate, encourage them to seek a 
priesthood blessing from local priesthood leaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796448" id="p177">Continue teaching them the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. Teach them that Heavenly Father, the Savior, and the Holy 
Ghost love them and want their success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796449" id="p178">Encourage them to attend church regularly and develop friendships with members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796450" id="p179">Be positive and supportive, especially if they relapse.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154796460" id="p183">You may wonder how you should adjust 
your teaching for people who do not have a Christian background. The 
principles that help a person build faith are the same in all cultures. 
Help people gain a correct understanding of God and the divine mission 
of Jesus Christ. The best way for them to learn these truths is by 
having personal spiritual experiences. Some ways you can help them have 
these experiences are outlined below:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154796461" id="p184">Teach that God is our Heavenly Father, and He loves us. We are His children. Invite them to seek that witness for themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796463" id="p186">Teach that God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796464" id="p187">Bear sincere testimony of the gospel, including how you feel Heavenly Father’s love and why you choose to follow Jesus Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796465" id="p188">Invite them to offer simple, heartfelt prayers—with you and on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796466" id="p189">Invite them to read the Book of Mormon daily—with you and on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796467" id="p190">Invite them to attend church.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796468" id="p191">Introduce them to members of the Church who can explain how they came to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154796470" id="p193">Most people desire to have a greater 
connection with God and to find purpose and meaning in life. Help them 
see how they are children of a loving Father in Heaven and how He has a 
plan for them. For example, you might begin by saying something like the
 following:</p>
<p data-aid="154796471" id="p208"><i>God is our Father in Heaven, and He
 loves us. We are His children. We lived with Him before we were born. 
Because we are all His children, we are all brothers and sisters. He 
desires us to return to Him. Because of His love for us, He has provided
 a way for us to return to Him through His Son, Jesus Christ.</i></p>

backgrounds say that they did not understand much of what the 
missionaries were teaching. However, they felt the Spirit and wanted to 
do what the missionaries asked. Do all you can to help people understand
 the doctrine of the gospel. Be patient and supportive. It may take time
 for people to learn to identify and express their feelings. You may 
need to adjust the pace and depth of your teaching to help them.</p>
<p data-aid="154796474" id="p195">The following suggestions may help as you prepare to teach people who do not have a Christian background:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154796475" id="p196">Understand what spiritual need or interest prompts them to meet with you.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154796478" id="p199">Define essential words and principles. People may not be familiar with many of the words you use as you teach.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p data-aid="154796528" id="aside3_p22">“Make a love for the word of God
 absolutely central to your mission culture. … Make familiarity with the
 revelations and regular use of the standard works one of the chief 
characteristics of your missionaries for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p data-aid="154796529" id="aside3_p23">“When you teach your 
missionaries—and that is all the time—teach them from the scriptures. 
Let them see where you get your strength and inspiration. Teach them to 
love and depend on those accumulated revelations.</p>
<p data-aid="154796530" id="aside3_p24">“[My] mission president taught 
from the Book of Mormon and [other] scriptures every time we were in his
 presence, or so it seemed. Personal interviews were laced with 
scripture. Outlines for … meetings were drawn from the standard 
works.&nbsp;…</p>
<p data-aid="154796531" id="aside3_p25">“We didn’t know it at the time, 
but our president was arming us on the right hand and on the left, 
exhorting us with all the energy of his soul and with all the faculty he
 possessed to hold fast to the iron rod in order that we would never 
perish [see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.23-25?lang=eng#p23">1&nbsp;Nephi 15:23–25</a>]” (“The Power of the Scriptures” seminar for new mission leaders, June&nbsp;25, 2022).</p>
