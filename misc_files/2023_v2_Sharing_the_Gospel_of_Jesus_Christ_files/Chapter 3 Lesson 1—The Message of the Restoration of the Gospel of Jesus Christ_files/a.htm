<p data-aid="154793243" id="p1">From the beginning of the world, God has
 revealed the gospel to His children through prophets. He has done this 
through His Son, Jesus Christ. Anciently, Jesus revealed the gospel to 
prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. But many people 
rejected it.</p>
<p data-aid="154793249" id="p2">Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ 
Himself taught His gospel and established His Church. People even 
rejected Jesus. Soon after His death, there was a widespread falling 
away from the Lord’s truth and Church. The fulness of the gospel and the
 priesthood authority were no longer on the earth.</p>
<p data-aid="154793255" id="p3">Centuries later, God called another 
prophet, Joseph Smith. God restored the fulness of the gospel through 
him and authorized him to organize the Church of Jesus Christ again.</p>
<p data-aid="154793261" id="p4">Having the fulness of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ on the earth is one of the great blessings of our day. The 
gospel helps us answer life’s most searching questions. Living prophets 
guide us through challenging times. The priesthood authority of God is 
once again on the earth to bless His children.</p>

<h4 data-aid="154793861" id="title20">Prophets Are God’s Representatives on Earth</h4>
</header>
<p data-aid="154793867" id="p57">One important way that God shows His 
love for us is by calling prophets, giving them priesthood authority, 
and inspiring them to speak for Him. Prophets are God’s representatives 
on earth. The Old Testament prophet Amos recorded that “the Lord God 
will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the 
prophets” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7?lang=eng#p7">Amos 3:7</a>). Some of the blessings we receive from living prophets are outlined below.</p>
<p data-aid="154796874" id="p59"><strong>Witnesses of Jesus Christ.</strong> Prophets are special witnesses of Jesus Christ, testifying of Him as our Savior and Redeemer.</p>
<p data-aid="154796880" id="p61"><strong>Teachings.</strong> Prophets 
receive direction from God to help us discern truth from error. They 
teach us to obey God’s commandments and to repent when we fall short. 
They denounce sin and warn of its consequences.</p>
<p data-aid="154796891" id="p62">Prophets’ teachings lift us toward God 
and help us receive the blessings He desires for us. Our greatest safety
 lies in following the word of the Lord given through His prophets.</p>
<p data-aid="154796898" id="p64"><strong>Priesthood Authority.</strong> 
The current prophet is the presiding priesthood holder on the earth. The
 priesthood is the authority and power of God. The prophet has the 
authority to speak and act in God’s name for the salvation of His 
children.</p>
<p data-aid="154796905" id="p66"><strong>Church Direction.</strong> The Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of prophets and apostles (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19-20?lang=eng#p19">Ephesians 2:19–20</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4.11-14?lang=eng#p11">4:11–14</a>).</p>

<h4 data-aid="154796912" id="title21">Prophets in Ancient Times</h4>
</header>
<p data-aid="154796919" id="p67">Adam was the first prophet on the 
earth. God revealed the gospel of Jesus Christ to him and gave him 
priesthood authority. Adam and Eve taught their children these truths 
and encouraged them to develop faith and to live the gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="154796926" id="p68">Eventually the posterity of Adam and 
Eve rebelled and turned away from the gospel. This led to a condition 
called apostasy, or a falling away. When widespread apostasy occurs, God
 withdraws His priesthood authority, which is necessary to teach and 
administer the ordinances of the gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="154796933" id="p69">The Old Testament records many 
instances of widespread apostasy. To end these periods, God reached out 
to His children by calling another prophet. He revealed the truths of 
the gospel anew to these prophets and gave them priesthood authority. 
Some of these prophets were Noah, Abraham, and Moses. Sadly, in a 
repeated pattern over time, people eventually rejected the prophets and 
fell away.</p>

that holy or inspired people receive some form of guidance and direction
 from Deity. However, not all inspired individuals are prophets of God.</p>
<p data-aid="154796961" id="aside2_p2">Explain that after each time of 
widespread apostasy, God restored the gospel through a prophet. He gave 
that prophet priesthood authority. The prophet helped people understand 
their relationship to God, including how to receive eternal life through
 the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154796975" id="aside2_p3">A dispensation of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ is a period of time in which there is least one authorized 
servant of the Lord on the earth who holds the keys of the priesthood. 
Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation has been revealed anew in every 
dispensation.</p>
<p data-aid="154796982" id="aside2_p4">There have been many gospel 
dispensations. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ, Joseph 
Smith, and others have each led a dispensation. The dispensation that 
began with Joseph Smith is known as the “dispensation of the fulness of 
times” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/1.10?lang=eng#p10">Ephesians 1:10</a>).

<h3 data-aid="154797071" id="title27">Jesus Christ’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797077" id="p70">Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Jesus 
and His Atonement are central to God’s plan for us. His Atonement 
included His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, His suffering and 
death on the cross, and His Resurrection.</p>
<p data-aid="154797083" id="p71">From the time of Adam and Eve, people 
looked forward to the coming of Jesus Christ as their Savior and 
Redeemer. Heavenly Father sent Jesus to earth more than 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p data-aid="154797089" id="p72">Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life. He
 taught His gospel and established His Church. He called twelve Apostles
 and gave them priesthood authority to teach and to perform sacred 
ordinances, such as baptism. He also gave them authority to lead His 
Church.</p>
<p data-aid="154797095" id="p73">At the end of His life, Jesus atoned 
for our sins by His suffering in Gethsemane and during His Crucifixion. 
Because of Jesus’s atoning sacrifice, we can be cleansed of our sins as 
we repent. This makes it possible for us to return to God’s presence and
 receive a fulness of joy.</p>
<p data-aid="154797101" id="p74">After Jesus was crucified, He was 
resurrected, gaining victory over death by the power of Heavenly Father.
 Because of Jesus’s Resurrection, all of us will be resurrected after we
 die. This means that each person’s spirit and body will be reunited, 
and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body.

<h3 data-aid="154797192" id="title30">The Falling Away</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797198" id="p76">After the death of Jesus Christ, His 
Apostles sought to keep the doctrine of Christ pure and to maintain 
order in the Church. However, many Church members turned away from the 
Apostles and from the doctrine that Jesus had taught.</p>
<p data-aid="154797203" id="p77">After the Apostles were killed, there 
was a widespread falling away from the gospel and Church of Jesus 
Christ. This falling away is sometimes called the Great Apostasy. 
Because of it, God withdrew priesthood authority from the earth. This 
loss included the authority needed to direct the Church. As a result, 
the Church that Jesus had established was no longer on the earth.</p>
<p data-aid="154797207" id="p78">During this time, people changed many 
gospel teachings. Much of the knowledge about the true nature of 
Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was distorted or lost.
 People also changed priesthood ordinances, such as baptism.</p>
<p data-aid="154797213" id="p79">Centuries later, truth-seeking men and 
women tried to reform the teachings and practices that had been changed.
 They sought greater spiritual light, and some of them spoke of the need
 for a restoration of truth. Their efforts led to the organization of 
many churches.</p>
<p data-aid="154797219" id="p80">This period of time resulted in an 
increased emphasis on religious freedom, which opened the way for the 
restoration of truth and authority from God.</p>
<p data-aid="154797225" id="p81">Prophets and apostles had foretold the falling away (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.1-3?lang=eng#p1">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:1–3</a>). They had also foretold that the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ would be restored to the earth (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/3.20-21?lang=eng#p20">Acts 3:20–21</a>). If there had not been a falling away, a restoration would not have been needed.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154797255" id="aside3_p2">Most people rejected Jesus Christ and His Apostles (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24.9?lang=eng#p9">Matthew 24:9</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.32-34?lang=eng#p32">1&nbsp;Nephi 11:32–34</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.5?lang=eng#p5">2&nbsp;Nephi 27:5</a>).
 After the deaths of the Apostles, the priesthood was lost from the 
earth. There was no longer authority to baptize or to direct the Church.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797261" id="aside3_p3">The Roman Empire, which at first 
had persecuted the Christians, later adopted Christianity. Important 
religious questions were settled by debate in councils rather than by 
revelation from God. Doctrine and ordinances were debated and changed to
 conform to worldly philosophies. Creeds, or statements of belief, were 
created based on the decisions of these councils (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng#p19">Joseph Smith—History 1:19</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797267" id="aside3_p4">Some people tried to reform 
Christianity by correcting what existed. However, because God’s 
priesthood authority was not on the earth, a restoration of authority 
and truth was needed to reestablish the Church of Jesus Christ.</p>

</header>
<section>
<header>
<h4 data-aid="154797361" id="title36">The First Vision and the Calling of Joseph Smith as a Prophet</h4>
</header>
<p data-aid="154797366" id="p82">During the centuries when the fulness 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ was not on the earth, Heavenly Father 
continued to reach out to His children. Over time, He prepared the way 
so they could be blessed again with the fulness of His gospel. When the 
circumstances were right, He called Joseph Smith as a prophet through 
whom the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ would be restored.</p>
<p data-aid="154797372" id="p83">Joseph Smith lived in the eastern 
United States at a time of great religious excitement. His family 
members were devoted to God and sought truth. Many churches claimed to 
have the truth, and Joseph desired to know which one was right (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.18?lang=eng#p18">Joseph Smith—History 1:18</a>). The Bible teaches there is “one Lord, one faith, one baptism” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4.5?lang=eng#p5">Ephesians 4:5</a>). As Joseph attended different churches, he was confused about which one to join. He later said:</p>
<p data-aid="154797378" id="p84">“So great were the confusion and strife
 among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person 
young as I was … to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who
 was wrong.&nbsp;…</p>
<p data-aid="154797384" id="p85">“In the midst of this war of words and 
tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of 
all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one
 of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.8,10?lang=eng#p8">Joseph Smith—History 1:8,&nbsp;10</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797390" id="p86">Like many people, Joseph Smith also had
 questions about the salvation of his soul. He wanted to have his sins 
forgiven and to be clean before God. As he sought truth among the 
different churches, he read in the Bible, “If any of you lack wisdom, 
let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth 
not; and it shall be given him” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/1.5?lang=eng#p5">James 1:5</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797396" id="p87">Because of this passage, Joseph decided
 to ask God what he should do. In the spring of 1820, he went to a grove
 of trees near his home and knelt in prayer. There are four accounts of 
the vision that followed, recorded by Joseph Smith or by scribes under 
his direction (see Gospel Topics Essays, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/first-vision-accounts?lang=eng">First Vision Accounts</a>”). In the account canonized as scripture, he described his experience as follows:</p>

<p data-aid="154797402" id="p88">“I saw a pillar of light exactly over 
my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually 
until it fell upon me.&nbsp;… When the light rested upon me I saw two 
Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing 
above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and 
said, pointing to the other—<em>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</em>” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.16-17?lang=eng#p16">Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="154797408" id="p89">In this vision, God the Father and His 
Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith. The Savior told him not to 
join any of the churches.</p>
<p data-aid="154797414" id="p90">In another account of this vision, 
Joseph shared that the Savior also told him: “Thy sins are forgiven 
thee.&nbsp;… Behold I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the 
world that all those who believe on my name may have Eternal life.”</p>
<p data-aid="154797420" id="p91">After the vision, Joseph reflected, “My
 soul was filled with love, and for many days I could rejoice with great
 joy and the Lord was with me” (<a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/3">Joseph Smith History, circa Summer 1832,&nbsp;3, josephsmithpapers.org</a>; spelling and punctuation modernized).</p>
<p data-aid="154797426" id="p92">Through this vision, Joseph Smith 
became a witness of Jesus Christ and learned important truths about the 
Godhead. For example, he learned that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ 
are separate beings. When They called him by name, he learned that They 
knew him personally. When Joseph was told that he was forgiven, he 
learned that God was merciful. This experience filled him with joy.</p>
<p data-aid="154797432" id="p93">As God had done with many previous 
prophets, He called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the 
fulness of the gospel would be restored to the earth. This restoration 
would help God’s children find joy in this world and eternal life in the
 world to come—all through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p data-aid="154797496" id="p99">Just as Jesus called Apostles during 
His mortal ministry to lead His Church, He has called Apostles to lead 
it today. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are
 prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
<p data-aid="154797501" id="p100">Only the senior Apostle is called <em>the</em>
 prophet because he presides over the entire Church and is uniquely 
authorized to speak for the Lord. He is the authorized successor to 
Joseph Smith. He and the present Apostles trace their authority to Jesus
 Christ in an unbroken chain of ordinations that began when Joseph Smith
 was ordained under the hands of the heavenly messengers.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="154797576" id="p101">The Book of Mormon is an ancient 
volume of holy scripture like the Bible. The Bible is one witness of 
Jesus Christ, and the Book of Mormon is a second witness of His 
ministry, His teachings, and His mission as our Savior.</p>
<p data-aid="154797581" id="p102">Joseph Smith was directed by a 
heavenly messenger named Moroni to a hill where an ancient record had 
been buried for centuries. This record, inscribed on gold plates (thin 
sheets of metal), contained the writings of prophets about God’s 
dealings with some of the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Joseph 
Smith translated this record by the gift and power of God.</p>
<p data-aid="154797586" id="p103">The prophets in the Book of Mormon 
knew about the mission of Jesus Christ and taught His gospel. After 
Jesus was resurrected, He appeared to these people and ministered 
personally to them. He taught them and established His Church.</p>
<p data-aid="154797591" id="p104">The Book of Mormon helps us draw 
closer to God as we learn, understand, and apply its teachings. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man [or woman] would get nearer to God
 by abiding by [the book’s] precepts, than by any other book” (<cite>Teachings: Joseph Smith</cite>,&nbsp;<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-4?lang=eng&amp;para=19#p19">64</a>).</p>

<p data-aid="154797596" id="p105">To know that the Book of Mormon is the
 word of God, we need to read it, ponder it, and pray about it. 
A&nbsp;Book of Mormon prophet promised that God would reveal the truth 
of the book to us as we pray with a sincere heart, with real intent, and
 with faith in Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng#p3">Moroni 10:3–5</a>). Studying the Book of Mormon is essential for enduring conversion.</p>
<p data-aid="154797600" id="p106">As we read the Book of Mormon and pray
 about it, we will learn truths about Jesus Christ that will bless our 
lives. We will also come to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God 
and that the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ have been restored 
through him.</p>

<p data-aid="154797711" id="aside6_p1">Like Joseph Smith, many people 
are searching for answers to important questions and for a connection to
 God. Share how prayer has helped you feel close to God. Share how you 
have received answers and guidance through study and prayer.</p>
<p data-aid="154797715" id="aside6_p2">Explain that prayer is a two-way 
communication with God. Invite those you teach to ask God for help and 
direction. Inviting people to pray is one of the most important 
invitations you can extend. As they receive answers, they will come to 
know that they are beloved children of God and that He will help them.</p>
<p data-aid="154797719" id="aside6_p3">Many of the people you teach will
 lack experience with prayer. It is a privilege for you to help them 
learn to pray and bring the blessings of prayer into their lives. Prayer
 is how we gain a witness of spiritual truths.</p>
<p data-aid="154797723" id="aside6_p4">Teach people that prayer normally consists of the following parts:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154797727" id="aside6_p5">Begin by addressing your Heavenly Father.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797731" id="aside6_p6">Express the feelings of your heart, such as gratitude for the blessings you have received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797735" id="aside6_p7">Ask questions, seek guidance, and ask for blessings you need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797739" id="aside6_p8">End by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="154797742" id="aside6_p9">Invite people to pray as they 
read the Book of Mormon to help them understand that it is the word of 
God and testifies of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="154797745" id="aside6_p10">When teaching people to pray, use simple language that they can also use when they pray. Keep these prayers brief.</p>
<p data-aid="154797749" id="aside6_p11">Invite the person you are teaching to offer a prayer at the end of the lesson. Testify that God hears and answers our prayers.</p>

<p data-aid="154797808" id="p111">The following outline is a sample of 
what you might teach someone if you have only a brief amount of time. 
When using this outline, select one or more principles to teach. The 
doctrinal foundation for each principle is provided earlier in the 
lesson.</p>
<p data-aid="154797811" id="p112">As you teach, ask questions and 
listen. Extend invitations that will help people learn how to grow 
closer to God. One important invitation is for the person to meet with 
you again. The length of the lesson will depend on the questions you ask
 and the listening you do.</p>

<h3 data-aid="154797814" id="title56">What You Might Teach People in 3–10 Minutes</h3>
</header>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="154797817" id="p113">God is our Heavenly Father, and He 
created us in His image. He knows us personally and loves us. He wants 
to bless us with peace and a fulness of joy that will last for eternity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797820" id="p114">Jesus Christ is the Son of God. His 
mission was to make it possible for us to be cleansed of our sins, 
overcome death, and receive eternal life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797823" id="p115">God calls prophets to be His 
representatives on earth. Anciently, He called prophets such as Adam, 
Noah, Abraham, and Moses. A living prophet receives revelation from God 
to teach and lead us today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797826" id="p116">During Jesus’s mortal ministry, He 
established His Church. After Jesus’s Apostles died, there was a 
widespread falling away from the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ. 
People changed many gospel teachings and priesthood ordinances, such as 
baptism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797829" id="p117">God called Joseph Smith to be a 
prophet, just as He had called prophets in earlier times. Heavenly 
Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him. The gospel of Jesus Christ was 
restored through him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797832" id="p118">The Book of Mormon is a volume of 
scripture. Like the Bible, it is a testament of Jesus Christ and helps 
us draw closer to God as we read it and apply its precepts. Joseph Smith
 translated it by the gift and power of God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="154797835" id="p119">Through sincere prayer, we can 
communicate with God. We can know that the message of the Restoration of
 the gospel of Jesus Christ is true.</p>
