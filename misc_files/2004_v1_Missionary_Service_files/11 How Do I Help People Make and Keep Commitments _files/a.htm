</header>
<p data-aid="128199531" id="p1">As a missionary, you desire the salvation of souls (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28.3?lang=eng#p3">Mosiah 28:3</a>). You know that people can come unto Christ and be saved only on conditions of repentance (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10-16?lang=eng#p10">Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–16</a>). One way to fulfill your desires is to cry repentance (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.49?lang=eng#p49">Alma 5:49</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15.6?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 15:6</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/16.6?lang=eng#p6">16:6</a>)
 and boldly invite people to exercise faith unto repentance, to be 
baptized by water and the Spirit, and to endure faithfully to the end 
(see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.16-20?lang=eng#p16">3&nbsp;Nephi 27:16–20</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/7.10?lang=eng#p10">Mormon 7:10</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128199532" id="p2">Commitment is an essential part of 
repentance. It is the act of obligating oneself to a course of action 
and then diligently following through on that decision. When people are 
genuinely committed, they have real intent, meaning that they fully 
intend to do what they have committed to do. They make an unwavering and
 earnest decision to change. They become devoted to Christ and dedicate 
themselves to His gospel. Keeping their commitment is how they “truly 
manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ 
unto the remission of their sins” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>). When you ask for commitments as part of your teaching, you are inviting people to repent.</p>
<p data-aid="137163570" id="p60"><span class="page-break" data-page="198"></span>Commitment
 is also an essential part of making and keeping covenants. Elder 
Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland taught: “When you teach [people] to keep their 
commitments, you are teaching them to become covenant-keepers” (“Making 
and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, April 25, 1997).
 People who keep commitments before baptism are more likely to make and 
keep covenants after baptism. Making and keeping covenants is an 
essential part of the gospel of Jesus Christ and God’s plan for His 
children.</p>
<p data-aid="128199533" id="p3">One of the best ways to help people make
 and keep commitments is to extend an invitation. Extending and 
following up on invitations is vital because:</p>

 Be constantly aware of the need to invite people to do things that will
 strengthen their faith in Christ. Remember the following principles:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128200412" id="p9">Every finding opportunity—with members, 
referrals, or personal contacting—should lead to an invitation to act, 
usually to learn more about the message of the Restoration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200415" id="p10">Rarely, if ever, should you talk to 
people or teach them without extending an invitation to do something 
that will strengthen their faith in Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200418" id="p11">Focus on one or more invitations when 
you teach. If you do not invite people to make commitments, you are not 
asking them to repent and come to Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200421" id="p12">As you prepare in companion study to 
teach a lesson, consider the needs and progress of each person and 
include one or more invitations in your lesson plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200423" id="p13">During a lesson you may be inspired to extend invitations other than those you planned. Always invite people to repent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200426" id="p14">Be bold and confident as you invite people to make commitments (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.12?lang=eng#p12">Alma 38:12</a>). Boldness shows your faith that obedience to the Lord’s commandments brings blessings.</p>

<p data-aid="128200467" id="p16">An invitation often takes the form of a “will you” question, which requires a <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>
 response. Invitations should be specific, direct, and clear. They 
invite or lead people to decide on a course of action. They require them
 to make a commitment and to exercise active faith in the principles you
 have taught them.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128199598" id="p24">People need a reason to change their 
thoughts and actions. Promised blessings often provide powerful 
motivation to obey God. When the Lord gives a commandment, He often 
promises blessings for keeping that commandment (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20-21?lang=eng#p20">Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21</a>). As you prepare people to obey a specific commandment, teach them that:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199599" id="p25">Living the commandments shows love for God and His Son.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199601" id="p27">In return, they will receive blessings 
that He has promised, including the greatest of all blessings, that of 
eternal life and exaltation for those who keep all His commandments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199602" id="p28">As you testify of a commandment, talk 
about the blessings you have received from living that commandment. 
Promise those whom you teach that they can enjoy similar blessings.</p>
<p data-aid="128199603" id="p29">As people strive to keep a commitment, 
ask them to talk about the blessings that Heavenly Father has given 
them. Assure them that even though difficulties will enter their lives, 
His blessings will continue as they obey His will.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199621" id="title5"><span class="page-break" data-page="201"></span>Bear Testimony Frequently</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199622" id="p30">A testimony is a spiritual witness and 
assurance given by the Holy Ghost. To bear testimony is to give a 
simple, direct declaration of belief—a feeling, an assurance, a 
conviction of gospel truth. Sharing your testimony often is one of the 
most powerful ways of inviting the Spirit and helping others feel the 
Spirit. It adds a current, personal witness to the truths you have 
taught from the scriptures. An effective missionary teaches, testifies, 
and invites others to do things that build faith in Jesus Christ. This 
includes making promises that come from living true principles. For 
example, a missionary might say, “I know as you keep the Sabbath day 
holy, you will find more peace in your heart.”</p>
<aside class="quote" id="aside1">
<p data-aid="128199623" id="aside1_p1">“Regarding one’s testimony, 
remember, that which one willingly shares he keeps, while that which he 
selfishly keeps he loses. … Teach and testify. There is no better 
combination.”</p>
<div class="citation-info">
<p data-aid="128199624" id="aside1_p2">—President Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson</p>
<p data-aid="128199625" id="aside1_p3"><cite>Pathways to Perfection</cite> (1973), 100–101</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p data-aid="128199626" id="p31">For your testimony to have convincing 
power, you must be sincere. Powerful testimony is not dependent on 
eloquence or the volume of your voice but on the conviction of your 
heart. Strive daily to strengthen your understanding and conviction of 
the doctrine and principles you are to teach. Bear testimony often to 
seal the truth of the principles or doctrine you are teaching. As often 
as possible, teach, then testify, and testify as you teach.</p>

<p data-aid="128199627" id="p32">Your testimony may be as simple as 
“Jesus Christ is the Son of God” or “I have learned for myself that the 
Book of Mormon is true.” You may also share a brief experience about how
 you gained this knowledge. Bear testimony several times in each lesson,
 not just at the end. Bear testimony that what your companion has taught
 is from God. Bear testimony that the principle you are going to teach 
will bless the person’s life if he or she will follow it. Talk about how
 living a principle has blessed your life.</p>
<p data-aid="128199628" id="p33">People may sometimes intellectually 
question what you teach, but it is difficult to question a sincere, 
heartfelt testimony. When you testify, pray that those you are teaching 
will feel the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost. When you testify, 
you help create an environment for people to feel the Holy Ghost 
confirming your witness of the truth. This prepares them to accept the 
invitations you will extend.</p>
<p data-aid="128199629" id="p34">Brigham Young was not baptized into The
 Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the first year of 
his learning about the restored gospel. But of his conversion he said: 
“If all the talent, tact, wisdom, and refinement of the world had been 
sent to me with the Book of Mormon, and had declared, in the most 
exalted of earthly eloquence, the truth of it, undertaking to prove it 
by learning and worldly wisdom, they would have been to me like smoke 
which arises only to vanish away. But when I saw a man without eloquence
 or talents for public speaking, who could only say, ‘I know by the 
power of the <span class="page-break" data-page="202"></span>Holy Ghost 
that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the 
Lord,’ the Holy Ghost proceeding from that individual illuminated my 
understanding, and a light, glory, and immortality were before me. I was
 encircled by them, filled with them, and I knew for myself that the 
testimony of the man was true” (in <cite>Journal of Discourses,</cite> 1:90).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128200572" id="p35">Extending an invitation without 
following up is like beginning a journey without finishing it or buying a
 ticket to a concert without going into the theater. Without the 
completed action, the commitment is hollow.</p>
<p data-aid="128200574" id="p36">Change can be hard. Your role is to 
help strengthen people in their resolve to change. You should do all you
 can to help people keep their commitments.</p>
<p data-aid="128200576" id="p37">Genuine repentance is best demonstrated
 by righteous actions over a period of time, especially for commandments
 such as chastity, the Word of Wisdom, and tithing. As you and ward 
leaders work with people to help them keep their commitments, show 
understanding. Be patient but persistent. You have not finished your 
ministry until people are living these commitments, or in other words, 
until they have repented (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.32?lang=eng#p32">3&nbsp;Nephi 18:32</a>).
 Sometimes several visits may be necessary for you to help people 
develop strong enough faith in a principle to lead to repentance.</p>
<p data-aid="128200578" id="p38">Following up begins when you first visit and teach people:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128200580" id="p39">Have them record their commitment, 
perhaps on their phone or calendar or on something you leave with them, 
such as a card with your names and phone number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200581" id="p40">Make sure people know that you or 
member friends will make brief contact with them daily between teaching 
appointments. Determine which method of communication they would prefer 
(brief visit, phone call, text message, email, social media message, and
 so on). Explain that your purpose in following up is to support and 
help them. Give them an idea of what you will do when you make contact 
each day. Be respectful of people’s time and wishes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="137163572" id="p61"><span class="page-break" data-page="203"></span>Make daily contact positive and comfortable to encourage and uplift those you teach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200583" id="p41">Record specific notes to follow up tomorrow on every invitation you have extended today.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128200585" id="p42">Make frequent contact, daily if 
possible, to find out how people are progressing with their commitments,
 answer questions, help them overcome challenges, teach additional 
lessons, read together from the Book of Mormon, share passages of 
scripture, introduce them to members, or share relevant Church media. As
 you contact and visit people often, you will strengthen the spiritual 
feelings they felt as you taught them the message of the Restoration of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. This sustaining influence of the Spirit is 
vital. There may be times when you call the people you are teaching to 
remind and encourage them to keep a commitment.</p>
<p data-aid="128200587" id="p43">Help people identify the blessings they
 have received as they have kept their commitments. Especially help them
 describe their feelings as the Spirit has testified of the truthfulness
 of the message.</p>
<p data-aid="128200588" id="p44">Compliment and encourage people who are
 succeeding in keeping commitments. The people you are teaching are 
changing their lives. They have a lot to learn and to do. Sincerely and 
frequently praise them. Express your gratitude for their progress and 
your confidence that they can succeed. Encourage them whenever you are 
with them.</p>
<p data-aid="128199676" id="p45">Express concern and disappointment when people fail to keep their commitments and thus fail to experience the blessings.</p>
