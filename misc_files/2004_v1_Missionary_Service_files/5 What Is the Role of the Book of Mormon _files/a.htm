<p data-aid="128204186" id="p1">The Book of Mormon, combined with the 
Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion. It provides 
powerful evidence for the divinity of Christ. It is also proof of the 
Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith. An essential part of 
conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of 
Mormon is true. As a missionary, you must first have a personal 
testimony that the Book of Mormon is true. This testimony can lead to a 
deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the 
conversion process. Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to 
anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is 
true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. This 
witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching.</p>

<p data-aid="128204189" id="p2">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng">introduction to the Book of Mormon</a>).
 On another occasion he stated: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the 
revelations, and where is our religion? We have none” (Minutes and 
Discourse, 21 April 1834, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).</p>
<p data-aid="128204190" id="p3">An arch is a strong architectural 
structure made from wedge-shaped pieces that lean against each other. 
The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges 
and locks the other stones in place. When Joseph Smith called the Book 
of Mormon “the keystone of our religion,” he taught that the Book of 
Mormon holds our religion together. President Ezra Taft Benson said that
 the Book of Mormon is the keystone in at least three ways:</p>
<p data-aid="128204191" id="p4"><strong>Witness of Christ.</strong> “The
 Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is 
Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His 
reality with power and clarity.”</p>
<p data-aid="128204192" id="p5"><strong>Fulness of doctrine.</strong> “The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9?lang=eng#p9">Doctrine and Covenants 20:9</a>[; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.5?lang=eng#p5">27:5</a>].)
 … In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of [the doctrine] 
required for our salvation. And [it is] taught plainly and simply so 
that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.”</p>

<p data-aid="128204193" id="p6"><strong>Foundation of testimony.</strong>
 “Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the 
Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The 
enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to 
such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can 
be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim
 to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in 
like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now 
testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed 
true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that 
accompanies it” (<cite>A Witness and a Warning</cite> [1988], 18–19).</p>
<p data-aid="128204194" id="p7">The Book of Mormon is the most correct of any book on the earth (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng">introduction to the Book of Mormon</a>).
 It teaches the doctrine of Christ plainly, especially in the lessons 
you teach people. Use it as your main source for teaching the restored 
gospel. The following are examples of truths taught plainly in the Book 
of Mormon that you will teach to people.</p>

<p data-aid="128204251" id="p8">A central purpose of the Book of Mormon is to convince all people that Jesus is the Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng">title page of the Book of Mormon</a>). It testifies of Christ by affirming the reality of His life, mission, and power. It teaches true doctrine concerning <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-3-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng#title2">Christ’s Atonement</a>—the
 foundation for the plan of salvation. Several of those whose writings 
are preserved in the Book of Mormon saw Christ personally. The brother 
of Jared, Nephi, and Jacob saw the premortal Christ. Mormon and Moroni 
saw the risen Christ. In addition, multitudes were present during the 
Savior’s brief but powerful ministry among the Nephites (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng">3&nbsp;Nephi 11–28</a>).
 Those who know little or nothing about the Savior will come to know Him
 by reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p data-aid="128204253" id="p9">The testimony of the Book of Mormon 
confirms the testimony of the Bible that Jesus is the Only Begotten Son 
of God and the Savior of the world. As you teach the fulness of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, you will testify often about the Savior and 
Redeemer of the world. By the power of the Holy Ghost, you will add your
 living witness of the truthfulness of this message.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128204299" id="title4">The Book of Mormon and the Bible Support Each Other</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128204301" id="p10">People’s beliefs about the Bible vary 
widely. Some believe that the Bible is absolutely perfect, without 
error, and that it is all we need to be saved. Others think the Bible is
 literature worth studying, but they deny that it is evidence of 
Christ’s divinity and miracles or direct revelation from God. Some 
choose to ignore the Bible, and others have never seen the Bible or had a
 chance to read it.</p>
<p data-aid="128204303" id="p11">Latter-day Saints “believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.8?lang=eng#p8">Articles of Faith 1:8</a>).
 Far from competing with the Bible, the Book of Mormon supports it, 
exhorts us to read it, and testifies of the truthfulness of its message.
 You should use the Book of Mormon and the Bible to support one another.</p>
<p data-aid="128204304" id="p12">The Book of Mormon speaks of the 
ancient covenants God made with His children; the Bible tells of great 
prophets who also received these covenants by faith. The Book of Mormon 
testifies of Christ and His Atonement; the Bible provides the account of
 His birth, ministry, death, Atonement, and Resurrection. Thus, the 
Bible and Book of Mormon complement and enrich each other.</p>
<p data-aid="128204306" id="p13">The LDS English edition of the King 
James Version of the Bible and the Book of Mormon have cross-references 
and study aids that make the stick of Judah (the Bible) and the stick of
 Joseph (the Book of Mormon) one in our hands (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/37.15-17?lang=eng#p15">Ezekiel 37:15–17</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.34-41?lang=eng#p34">1&nbsp;Nephi 13:34–41</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.12?lang=eng#p12">2&nbsp;Nephi 3:12</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.8?lang=eng#p8">29:8</a>).
 Give priority to Book of Mormon passages when you teach, but also show 
how the Book of Mormon and the Bible teach the same principles.</p>
<p data-aid="128204308" id="p14">Use the Book of Mormon to clarify and 
explain Bible passages. For example, the New Testament states that 
Christ was baptized to “fulfil all righteousness” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/3.14-15?lang=eng#p14">Matthew 3:14–15</a>). The Book of Mormon explains what it means to fulfill all righteousness (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.5-9?lang=eng#p5">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:5–9</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128204310" id="p15">As you use the Book of Mormon and the 
Bible as companion volumes of scripture, they will overcome contention 
and correct false doctrine (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.12?lang=eng#p12">2&nbsp;Nephi 3:12</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128204311" id="p16">The Bible teaches the following about 
the law of witnesses: “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall 
every word be established” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/13.1?lang=eng#p1">2&nbsp;Corinthians 13:1</a>). In harmony with this law, both the Book of Mormon and the Bible testify of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p data-aid="128204384" id="p36">As we read the Book of Mormon with the 
guidance of the Spirit, it helps us answer personal questions. It 
teaches that prayer and revelation are the key to solving particular 
problems. It helps us have faith that God will answer our prayers.</p>
<p data-aid="128204385" id="p37">The Book of Mormon also helps us 
understand that God’s commandments are not a restrictive list of dos and
 don’ts but guideposts to a happy, abundant life. As we begin to 
understand that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are 
the way to the abundant life, we will appreciate that these principles 
help answer any question and fill any need. For example, we understand 
that repentance, forgiveness, and the covenant to serve others are 
essential in improving relationships with our spouses. We see that faith
 in Christ, accepting and keeping covenants, and following the 
promptings of the Spirit can help teenagers avoid the powerful 
temptations that surround them.</p>
<p data-aid="128204387" id="p38">The gospel can resolve almost any

</header>
<p data-aid="128204395" id="p39">Regarding the Book of Mormon, the 
Prophet Joseph Smith said that “a man would get nearer to God by abiding
 by its precepts, than by any other book” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng">introduction to the Book of Mormon</a>).
 The Book of Mormon is a springboard to testimony and personal 
revelation. Use the Book of Mormon to help people have spiritual 
experiences, especially a witness from the Holy Ghost that the book 
itself is true. By consistently inviting people to live the principles 
found in the Book of Mormon, you help them develop faith in Jesus Christ
 and draw nearer to God.</p>
<p data-aid="128204396" id="p40">President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley 
declared: “Those who have read [the Book of Mormon] prayerfully, be they
 rich or poor, learned or unlearned, have grown under its power. … 
Without reservation I promise you that if you will prayerfully read the 
Book of Mormon, regardless of how many times you previously have read 
it, there will come into your hearts … the Spirit of the Lord. There 
will come a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to his 
commandments, and there will come a stronger testimony of the living 
reality of the Son of God” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1988/06/the-power-of-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng&amp;para=p51#p51">The Power of the Book of Mormon</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> June 1988, 6).</p>

<p data-aid="128204400" id="p43">“…&nbsp;All objections, whether they be

<p data-aid="128204402" id="p44">“…&nbsp;The only problem the objector 
has to resolve for himself is whether the Book of Mormon is true. For if
 the Book of Mormon is true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was 
his prophet, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, 
and it is being led today by a prophet receiving revelation.</p>
<p data-aid="128204403" id="p45">“Our main task is to declare the gospel
 and do it effectively. We are not obligated to answer every objection. 
Every man eventually is backed up to the wall of faith, and there he 
must make his stand” (<cite>A Witness and a Warning,</cite> 4–5).</p>
<p data-aid="128204404" id="p46">For example, sincere people might 
object to what you have taught about the Word of Wisdom. Help them see 
that their real question is whether Joseph Smith was speaking as God’s 
prophet when this commandment was renewed in this dispensation. You 
might say: “Having the faith to accept this teaching will require the 
assurance that this commandment came to us through revelation from God 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The way to know that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet of God is to read and pray about the Book of Mormon.”</p>
<p data-aid="128204405" id="p47">People must resolve for themselves 
their concerns and objections. You can help as you focus them on what 
will strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ—reading and praying about 
the Book of Mormon. When they strengthen their testimony of the 
Restoration, they will have the strength to overcome their objections 
and concerns.</p>
<p data-aid="128204406" id="p48">As you answer concerns, remember that 
our understanding comes from modern prophets—Joseph Smith and his 
successors—who receive direct revelation from God. Therefore, the first 
question someone should answer is whether Joseph Smith was a prophet, 
and he or she can answer this question by reading and praying about the 
Book of Mormon.</p>

important doctrine to look for as you read with them. Share appropriate

you and those you teach must be willing to act on the doctrine, to

<p data-aid="128204451" id="p78">Read the following true account and 
discuss what you learn concerning the importance and power of the Book 
of Mormon (names have been changed).</p>
<p data-aid="128204452" id="p79">“When we invited the Sniders to be 
baptized and confirmed, Sister Snider was ready, but Brother Snider 
said, ‘Don’t get your hopes up, Elders. I don’t know if I can ever do 
this!’ Although Brother Snider accepted what we taught and was always 
warm and friendly, he was deeply concerned about how his family would 
react to his joining another church.</p>
<p data-aid="128204453" id="p80">“After several weeks of watching Brother Snider struggle, my companion and I felt impressed to again read <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng">3&nbsp;Nephi 11</a>
 with the Sniders. I will never forget what happened that night. As we 
opened the Book of Mormon, my companion explained, ‘This chapter, as you
 might recall, recounts the Savior’s visit to the people in the Book of 
Mormon. Here we read about the Savior’s love for these people and what 
He taught them.’ We each took turns reading a verse or two. After 
reading through verse&nbsp;5, my companion interrupted and said, ‘I have
 always been impressed with the description given here of the voice they
 heard. The voice was not harsh, it was not loud, and although it was a 
small voice, it had a powerful piercing effect on them. This voice was 
not only heard with their ears, but it spoke to their hearts.’ I watched
 the Sniders as they listened intently to my companion.</p>
<p data-aid="128204454" id="p81">“After some discussion about prayer and
 listening to the Spirit, it was Brother Snider’s turn to read: ‘And 
behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; 
and it said unto them: Behold my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,
 in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.’ Brother Snider paused, 
looking intently at his Book of Mormon. Then he looked up at me and 
said, ‘Heavenly Father was really proud of His Son, wasn’t He?’ ‘Yes,’ I
 said. Brother Snider looked back at his book again and stared at the 
open pages as if deep in thought. Finally he said, ‘I would want 
Heavenly Father to be proud of me too. I wonder how He would introduce 
me. I guess, if I … well, if I want Him to be proud of me then I had 
better do what He wants me to do.’ ‘Yes, I think that would be 
important,’ I replied. ‘Well,’ Brother Snider continued. ‘I think I’ve 
been worrying too much about what everybody else thinks and not enough 
about what God thinks.’ After a brief pause Brother Snider nodded and 
with a determined look said, ‘I think I had better be baptized.’ His 
response was so unexpected that my companion and I looked at him with 
blank stares. Finally, my companion said, ‘Yes, that would be the right 
thing to do. In fact, later on in this chapter the Savior 
teaches&nbsp;…’ As my companion talked I felt a burning in my heart and 
gratitude for the power of the Book of Mormon.”</p>

<p data-aid="128204474" id="p99">Help missionaries see how the Book of 
Mormon teaches the doctrine from the missionary lessons. For example, if
 the topic were the Atonement of Jesus Christ, have missionaries write 
in one column each major element of Christ’s Atonement taught in the 
Book of Mormon, including the scripture references. Then, in a second 
column, have them list side-by-side those same elements as taught in the
 Bible. Have your missionaries leave blank those elements that are 
missing or not taught in the Bible. It will become very evident to the 
missionaries how the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our doctrine. 
This same activity can be done with other doctrine that missionaries 
teach.</p>
