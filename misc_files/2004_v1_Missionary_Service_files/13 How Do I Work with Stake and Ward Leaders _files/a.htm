working with many leaders and members during your mission. Together you 
will strengthen and establish The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. The relationships you establish with Church leaders will bless 
you for the rest of your life. These are important relationships as you 
and Church members seek to bring the restored gospel to Heavenly 
Father’s children. Understanding the basics of how to work within the 
ward organization will help you move forward with greater focus and

</header>
<p data-aid="128201042" id="p2">When converts are baptized and 
confirmed, they make sacred promises to obey and serve God and others 
for the rest of their lives. They become candidates for salvation in the
 celestial kingdom. To receive the promised blessings, they must endure 
to the end with faith in Jesus Christ. Church members are essential in 
helping new converts remain active and faithful.</p>
<p data-aid="128201044" id="p3">President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley said: 
“There is absolutely no point in doing missionary work unless we hold on
 to the fruits of that effort. The two must be inseparable. … Every 
convert is a great and serious responsibility” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p59#p59">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1999, 108).</p>
<p data-aid="128201045" id="p4">Under the direction of the bishop, the 
ward council has first responsibility for strengthening new members and 
returning members. They make sure that new converts and returning 
members have friends, are nourished by the word of God, and receive 
callings and responsibilities. They may request that full-time 
missionaries help minister to and visit new members, returning members, 
and prospective elders. Preferably you will be paired with a member for 
such visits.</p>
<p data-aid="128201047" id="p5">You are also responsible for these 
people. President Hinckley said: “You missionaries … are part of this 
responsibility of binding your converts to the Church. You may not be 
able to continue to visit them. But you can write to them occasionally 
and give them encouragement. … When you go home do not forget them. At 
all times live worthy of their trust. Write to them occasionally, 
assuring them of your love” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p75#p75">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” 109).</p>

<p data-aid="128201049" id="p6">When attending Church meetings, you and 
your companion should sit with visitors or members you have been 
fellowshipping to support and strengthen them. You should not sit in a 
group with other missionaries.</p>
<p data-aid="128201050" id="p7">A vital part of your mission is to 
establish the Church and strengthen the unit in which you serve. You do 
this in part by helping new converts remain active and by helping 
returning members become active. One of your duties is to lead out in 
teaching all five missionary lessons to new members after baptism and, 
when appropriate, to returning members. Ward missionaries and 
ministering brothers and sisters can also help teach these principles.</p>
<p data-aid="128201052" id="p8">President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley related the following concerning the challenges many new converts face:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128201054" id="p9">I received the other day a very interesting letter. It was written by a woman who joined the Church a year ago. She writes:</p>
<p data-aid="128201055" id="p10">“My journey into the Church was unique 
and quite challenging. This past year has been the hardest year that I 
have ever lived in my life. It has also been the most rewarding. As a 
new member, I continue to be challenged every day.”</p>
<p data-aid="128201057" id="p11">She goes on to say that when she joined
 the Church she did not feel support from the leadership in her ward. 
Her bishop seemed indifferent to her as a new member. Rebuffed, as she 
felt, she turned back to her mission president, who opened opportunities
 for her.</p>
<p data-aid="128201059" id="p12">She states that “Church members don’t 
know what it is like to be a new member. … Therefore, it’s almost 
impossible for them to know how to support us.”</p>
<p data-aid="128201060" id="p13">I challenge you, my brothers and 
sisters, that if you do not know what it is like, you try to imagine 
what it is like. It can be terribly lonely. It can be disappointing. It 
can be frightening. We of this Church are far more different from the 
world than we are prone to think we are. This woman goes on: “When we … 
become members of the Church, we are surprised to discover that we have 
entered into a completely foreign world, a world that has its own 
traditions, culture, and language. We discover that there is no one 
person or no one place of reference that we can turn to for guidance in 
our trip into this new world. At first the trip is exciting, our 
mistakes even amusing, then it becomes frustrating and eventually, the 
frustration turns into anger. And it’s at these stages of frustration 
and anger that we leave. We go back to the world from which we came, 
where we knew who we were, where we contributed, and where we could 
speak the language” [“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p60#p60">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” 108].</p>

<p data-aid="128201077" id="p15">Teaching and baptizing new converts is 
under the direction of your mission president. However, the work of 
proclaiming the gospel will move forward more powerfully when full-time 
missionaries and members coordinate their efforts and work in unity 
together. You may often be invited to attend ward council meetings. 
However, your first priority is to make sure that the people you are 
teaching are at church. Frequently this will mean that you will 
accompany them. If there is a conflict between attending ward council 
meeting and getting someone to church, do the latter. In this case, 
provide a copy of the Progress Record to the ward mission leader and 
ensure that he has all the information needed for ward council.</p>
<p data-aid="128201079" id="p16">President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley said:</p>
<p data-aid="128201081" id="p17">“Every new convert needs three things:</p>
<ol class="decimal" start="1">
<li data-marker="“1.">
<p data-aid="128201082" id="p18">A friend in the Church to whom he can 
constantly turn, who will walk beside him, who will answer his 
questions, who will understand his problems.</p>
</li>
<li data-marker="“2.">
<p data-aid="128201084" id="p19">An assignment. Activity is the genius 
of this Church. It is the process by which we grow. Faith and love for 
the Lord are like the muscle of my arm. If I use them, they grow 
stronger. If I put them in a sling, they become weaker. Every convert 
deserves a responsibility.&nbsp;…</p>
</li>
<li data-marker="“3.">
<p data-aid="128201086" id="p20">Every convert must be ‘nourished by the good word of God’ (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4?lang=eng#p4">Moro. 6:4</a>).
 It is imperative that he or she become affiliated with a priesthood 
quorum or the Relief Society, the Young Women, the Young Men, the Sunday
 School, or the Primary. He or she must be encouraged to come to 
sacrament meeting to partake of the sacrament, to renew the covenants 
made at the time of baptism” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1999/04/find-the-lambs-feed-the-sheep?lang=eng&amp;para=p65#p65">Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep</a>,” 108).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p data-aid="128201087" id="p21">The ward council will take the lead in 
providing a friend, responsibility, and spiritual nourishment for new 
converts. You will help them as requested. Priesthood leaders and 
members will do the fellowshipping, with your assistance.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201140" id="p40">The full-time mission president holds 
the keys for convert baptisms. Under his direction, full-time 
missionaries have primary responsibility for teaching the gospel to 
people not of our faith. However, the bishop oversees the person’s 
progress and friendshipping as he or she is being taught. The ward 
mission plan is carried out under the presiding authority of the bishop.
 The mission president meets regularly with stake presidents to make 
sure that full-time missionaries cooperate with local priesthood 
leaders. He coordinates missionary efforts and offers to help the stake 
president provide instruction in the principles and practices of 
missionary work.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128201142" id="title9">What Are the Responsibilities of Stake and Ward Leaders?</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128201144" id="p41">Local Church leaders and members are 
your best allies. Respect them and strive to build good relationships 
with them. As you work with these leaders, remember that they have other
 responsibilities associated with their callings. Seek to be a blessing,
 not a burden, to the leaders of your stake and ward. Your attitude 
should be one of “How can we help?” Counsel with the bishop and ward 
mission leader concerning your plans and activities. Make sure that what
 you do supports the ward mission plan.</p>
<p data-aid="128201145" id="p42">The roles of local priesthood 
leadership in missionary work are described below. Understanding their 
roles will help you better work with them.</p>

 their missionary, retention, and activation responsibilities. In his 
monthly interview with bishops, he discusses plans and the progress of 
members and those being taught by missionaries. He ensures that the 
doctrine relating to missionary work is taught regularly in stake and 
ward meetings and that priesthood leaders and others are trained in 
their missionary responsibilities.</p>
<p data-aid="128201150" id="p44">The stake president also meets 
regularly with the mission president to coordinate missionary efforts, 
including the training of leaders and members, use and placement of 
full-time missionaries, and assistance in activation efforts.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201188" id="p59">Ward missionary work is normally 
coordinated in ward council meetings through use of the Progress Record.
 The missionary objective of these meetings is to report, plan, and 
coordinate assignments to find, teach, fellowship, and activate as 
outlined in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p data-aid="128201190" id="p60"><i>Finding People to Teach.</i> The 
ward council discusses plans for preparing specific people to be taught 
by the full-time missionaries. Members of the ward council discuss the 
progress of specific ward members in preparing individuals and families 
for the missionary lessons.</p>
<p data-aid="128201191" id="p61"><i>Teaching and Baptizing.</i> The ward
 council reviews the Progress Record each week, which describes the 
progress of each person being taught by the full-time missionaries. 
Members of the ward council also coordinate plans for teaching in 
members’ homes, fellowshipping those being taught, and ensuring member 
participation at baptismal services.</p>
<p data-aid="128201193" id="p62"><i>Fellowshipping and Teaching New Members.</i>
 The ward council reviews the New and Returning Member Progress form to 
monitor the progress of each new member. Members of the ward council 
also discuss how to fellowship new members. As requested by the bishop, 
they recommend potential callings for new converts.</p>
<p data-aid="128201194" id="p63"><i>Fellowshipping and Teaching Returning Members.</i>
 The ward council coordinates activation efforts of the elders quorum 
and the full-time missionaries. Members of the ward council also plan 
how to fellowship returning members, especially by inviting them to 
Church meetings and activities.</p>

<p data-aid="128201198" id="p64">Missionary work in the ward is normally
 coordinated in ward council meetings. If additional coordination is 
necessary, the ward mission leader may hold missionary coordination 
meetings with the full-time missionaries. Others who may be invited to 
attend this meeting include ward missionaries, a counselor from the 
elders quorum presidency, and a counselor from the Relief Society 
presidency.</p>
<p data-aid="128201199" id="p65">Those attending the meeting may review 
and report on assignments and goals from the previous meeting and 
discuss plans for the coming week. As needed, they may also coordinate 
the assignments of ward missionaries to work with full-time missionaries
 and discuss how to make the combined efforts of ward missionaries and 
full-time missionaries more effective.</p>

<h3 data-aid="128201201" id="title18">Ward Mission Plan</h3>
</header>
<p data-aid="128201203" id="p66">Bishops of many wards have found that 
developing a ward mission plan promotes ward missionary work. Such a 
plan may include goals, initiatives, and activities to help ward members
 invite people to hear the gospel. Individuals and families also benefit
 from developing such a plan to guide their missionary efforts.</p>
<p data-aid="128201204" id="p67">Members should use every honorable 
means to find people who are willing to listen to the message of the 
Restoration. They should emphasize finding fathers, mothers, and 
children who will come into the Church as families. Following are some 
suggestions for bishops to consider in developing a mission plan.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128201206" id="p68">Pray that the Lord will prepare the 
hearts of specific people to hear the gospel. Pray also to be sensitive 
to those whom He is preparing (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/6.6?lang=eng#p6">Alma 6:6</a>).
 “It will be a great day,” taught President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley, 
“when our people not only pray for the missionaries throughout the 
world, but ask the Lord to help them to assist the missionaries who are 
laboring in their own ward” (“Missionary Service,” <cite>First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</cite> Jan. 2003, 19).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201208" id="p69">Be aware of opportunities to reach out to others. Be neighborly and reach out in love to all people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201209" id="p70">Ask friends and neighbors to serve 
alongside members in such things as providing community service, 
providing meals to those in need, teaching workshops in weekday Relief 
Society meetings, helping with ward activities, helping people move, 
assisting with youth activities, and helping with family history or 
welfare projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201211" id="p71">Invite nonmember relatives, friends, and neighbors to baptisms, confirmations, and priesthood ordinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201212" id="p72">Invite nonmembers to assist in special events, such as a breakfast on a national holiday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201214" id="p73">Make ward meetings, activities, 
devotionals, and open houses enjoyable and uplifting so that members 
feel eager to invite acquaintances to attend.</p>

<p data-aid="128201216" id="p74">Invite people to home evenings.</p>

<p data-aid="128201236" id="p81">Missionary work has its greatest effect
 as people make and keep the commitment to stay active in the Church all
 the days of their lives. It is not enough for people to simply come 
into the Church. They must come to stay. All of your teaching and 
invitations must be directed toward this end. In order to receive all 
the blessings that our Heavenly Father has in store for them, members 
must continue to live the gospel and be active in the Church.</p>

<p data-aid="128201262" id="p88">Read the following quotation, in which President Joseph&nbsp;F. Smith describes his feelings at the time of his baptism:</p>
<p data-aid="128201264" id="p89">“The feeling that came upon me was that
 of pure peace, of love and of light. I felt in my soul that if I had 
sinned—and surely I was not without sin—that it had been forgiven me; 
that I was indeed cleansed from sin; my heart was touched, and I felt 
that I would not injure the smallest insect beneath my feet. I felt as 
if I wanted to do good everywhere to everybody and to everything. I felt
 a newness of life, a newness of desire to do that which was right. 
There was not one particle of desire for evil left in my soul. … This 
was the influence that came upon me, and I know that it was from God, 
and was and ever has been a living witness to me of my acceptance of the
 Lord” (<cite>Gospel Doctrine,</cite> 5th ed. [1939], 96).</p>
<p data-aid="128201265" id="p90">Now read what President Smith said about his feelings long after his baptism:</p>
<p data-aid="128201267" id="p91">“Oh! that I could have kept that same 
spirit and that same earnest desire in my heart every moment of my life 
from [the day of my baptism] to this. Yet many of us who have received 
that witness, that new birth, that change of heart, while we may have 
erred in judgment or have made many mistakes, and often perhaps come 
short of the true standard in our lives, we have repented of the evil, 
and we have sought from time to time forgiveness at the hand of the 
Lord; so that until this day the same desire and purpose which pervaded 
our souls when we were baptized and received a remission of our sins, 
still holds possession of our hearts, and is still the ruling sentiment 
and passion of our souls” (<cite>Gospel Doctrine,</cite> 96).</p>
