<p data-aid="128199220" id="p1">You are called to teach the restored 
gospel to as many people as will receive you. Teaching is central to 
everything you do. You develop Christlike attributes, study the 
missionary lessons, improve your ability to speak in your mission 
language, and rely on the Spirit in order to teach with convincing 
power. The Lord stated this very simply as a commandment with a promise:</p>
<p data-aid="128199221" id="p2">“Seek not to declare my word, but first 
seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if 
you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God 
unto the convincing of men” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.21?lang=eng#p21">Doctrine and Covenants 11:21</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128199223" id="p3">“Neither take ye thought beforehand what
 ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of 
life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall
 be meted unto every man” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85?lang=eng#p85">Doctrine and Covenants 84:85</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128199225" id="p4">The First Presidency and Quorum of the 
Twelve Apostles have stated: “Our purpose is to teach the message of the
 restored gospel in such a way as to allow the Spirit to direct both the
 missionaries and those being taught. It is essential to learn the 
[missionary lessons] but these should not be taught by rote 
presentation. The missionary should feel free to use his own words as 
prompted by the Spirit. He should not give a memorized recitation, but 
speak from the heart in his own terms. He may depart from the order of 
the lessons, giving that which he is inspired to do, according to the 
interest and needs of the <span class="page-break" data-page="178"></span>[individual].
 Speaking out of his own conviction and in his own words he should bear 
testimony of the truth of his teachings” (“Statement on Missionary 
Work,” First Presidency letter, Dec. 11, 2002).</p>
<p data-aid="128199226" id="p5">Learn to rely on the Spirit to give you 
what you should say and do. By studying, developing, and using the 
teaching skills in this chapter, you will become a more capable 
instrument in the hands of the Lord. The Spirit will draw upon the 
knowledge and skills you have developed to help you teach more 
powerfully. The quality and power of your teaching will help others 
understand and feel the importance the restored gospel has for them. 
Their understanding will be influenced by your personal worthiness. 
Their understanding will also be influenced by how well you focus your 
attention on them and listen and by how well you explain the gospel, use
 the scriptures, share your testimony, ask questions, and invite them to
 make and keep commitments.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199243" id="title2">How to Begin Teaching</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199245" id="p6">The first few moments with people are 
very important. They must learn to trust you. Begin your first visit in a
 warm, respectful, genuine manner. Ask a few simple questions to help 
you understand their religious background and their expectations 
regarding your visits. For example, ask, “What role has religion played 
in your life?” Do not, however, ask personal questions that would make 
them uncomfortable.</p>
<p data-aid="128199246" id="p7">Before you begin, ask all who are 
present to join with you in the lesson. Encourage them to turn off the 
television and remove other distractions so that the Spirit of the Lord 
will not be hindered.</p>
<p data-aid="128199248" id="p8">Explain that you would like to begin and
 end each lesson in prayer. Suggest that you will offer the opening 
prayer. Pray simply but fervently that the Lord will bless the people 
you are teaching in every aspect of their lives, and especially that 
they can feel the truth of what you will teach.</p>
<p data-aid="128199250" id="p9">Demonstrate sincere interest and love for them and faith in the converting power of the gospel (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.43-48?lang=eng#p43">Moroni 7:43–48</a>). As guided by the Spirit, you may express thoughts such as the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199251" id="p10">Because God is our Heavenly Father, we are all brothers and sisters. We would like to refer to you as brothers and sisters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199253" id="p11"><span class="page-break" data-page="179"></span>Each
 person we teach has personal challenges and concerns. No matter what 
your needs or concerns might be, the Savior and His teachings—the 
gospel—will help you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199255" id="p12">Our message will enable you to improve 
the quality of your lives. It will help you deal with the problems and 
challenges that we all face in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199256" id="p13">Our message, which is centered in Jesus Christ, is of great value and importance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199258" id="p14">We all make mistakes in life, and these
 mistakes create feelings of guilt and shame. These feelings cannot be 
relieved without repentance and forgiveness. They can be fully healed 
through the Atonement of Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199260" id="p15">Our message cannot be learned all at 
once. Understanding will come over time through prayer, study, 
experience, and keeping God’s commandments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199261" id="p16">We have weaknesses, as everyone does. 
We may not speak the language very well or be able to answer every 
question you have. But we have been called by a prophet of God to share 
what we know. We know that our message is true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199263" id="p17">We will be guides so that you can learn
 the truth of our message for yourselves. It is your choice to accept 
and act on the message. Therefore, you should feel free to ask 
questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199265" id="p18">As you sincerely seek to understand our message, you may face challenges, but God will help you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199266" id="p19">As you accept our message, you will 
learn how to make covenants, or promises, with God. You will learn how 
to make changes to bring your lives in closer harmony with His 
teachings. You will want to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and be 
baptized by proper authority (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3.5?lang=eng#p5">John 3:5</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199268" id="p20">Before teaching the doctrine in a 
lesson, consider giving a simple overview of what you are going to 
teach. Help people see that it will have personal relevance for them. 
Many of the people you teach have been prepared by the Lord (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/16.16-17?lang=eng#p16">Alma 16:16–17</a>). As you share spiritual experiences together in the first meeting, they will recognize you as servants of the Lord.</p>

<p data-aid="128199275" id="p21">Each person or family you teach is 
unique. Even though you will not understand all of their interests, 
achievements, needs, and concerns, you should seek to be sensitive to 
their circumstances. Regardless of needs or problems, all people are 
best helped as they accept and live the gospel. You will be able to 
adjust your teaching as you listen to the promptings of the Spirit.</p>
<p data-aid="128199276" id="p22">Let the Spirit guide the order in which
 you present the lessons based on the needs, interests, questions, and 
situations of those you teach. You may use more than one meeting to 
teach the <span class="page-break" data-page="180"></span>principles in 
one lesson, and occasionally you may teach the contents of two lessons 
in a single meeting. Heavenly Father knows His children, so rely on 
inspiration to make these decisions as you teach. Pray for the gift of 
discernment, and pay attention to thoughts that come to your mind or 
feelings you have about what to teach.</p>
<p data-aid="128199278" id="p23">You will need to adjust your teaching 
to give more attention to those commitments that are more difficult for 
an individual to keep. For example, one person may easily accept the 
Book of Mormon as the word of God, while another may struggle to accept 
anything but the Bible. One person may have trouble giving up tobacco 
but will readily accept the law of tithing.</p>
<p data-aid="128199280" id="p24">As you plan when to teach certain 
doctrinal principles, be sensitive about how much new information you 
share. Teach at a pace that is appropriate for the person. Some will 
progress faster or slower than others. Make sure that you ask enough 
questions and listen carefully to their answers so you have a firm 
understanding of how quickly and how well they are learning and applying
 the doctrine you are presenting.</p>
<p data-aid="128199281" id="p25">Be sensitive to time. Most teaching 
appointments should not last beyond 45 minutes. A teaching visit can be 
completed, however, in 15 or 20 minutes if needed. If the person has 
only 15 minutes to meet with you, adjust your teaching to respect that 
limitation.</p>
<p data-aid="128199283" id="p26">Trust in the promise that the Spirit will give you “in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.6?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 100:6</a>).</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199320" id="title5">Invite Members to Help You Teach</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199322" id="p29">Whenever possible invite members, 
preferably recent converts, to help you teach. The ideal situation is to
 include Church members who formerly belonged to the same church as the 
people you are teaching. Show the members a copy of the lesson, and 
discuss what you want them to teach. Discuss how to work together. For 
example, have the members, as appropriate, share how they were able to 
learn, accept, and live a particular principle in the lesson. Have them 
explain how they made the decision to join the Church. When members join
 in teaching, they will have the opportunity to feel the joy of 
missionary work. It also provides friendship for those you are teaching.
 President Thomas&nbsp;S. Monson taught:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199324" id="p30">During the teaching process [people] 
can be benefitted by the strength of a member couple’s testimony who 
have in recent years made the step to baptism and membership. In the 
Canadian Mission in Ontario and Quebec, where our family lived when I 
presided over the mission, we found that the majority of the population 
belonged to perhaps three dominant faiths: Roman Catholic, Anglican, and
 the United Church of Canada. In every city of the mission we arranged 
for a newly baptized family from each of these faiths to be available to
 the missionaries who were in the process of teaching new [people] so 
that such a member couple could accompany the missionary team on perhaps
 the second or third visit.</p>
<p data-aid="128199325" id="p31">Can you appreciate, for example, when 
missionaries [were] working with those from the United Church of Canada,
 the strength of testimony of [a brother and sister] who had come from 
the United Church of Canada. [The husband] would say, “When I joined The
 Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, … I found the truth in its
 entirety. You too can make the adjustment. You too can make the same 
decision. In fact, let us pick you up on Sunday morning so that we can 
sit together in church. Then you can hear and feel for yourself. We’ll 
be right by your side.”</p>
<p data-aid="128199327" id="p32">Anthony and Edith Belfiglio became such
 a fellowshipping couple to those who had Roman Catholic roots. The 
result was the same. It can be done. And such converts stay converted. 
In addition, the couples chosen to fulfill this assignment put their own
 roots even deeper in the rich soil of the gospel. … Brother Belfiglio 
became [an] ordained [patriarch] (missionary training satellite 
broadcast, Apr. 25, 2003).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128199340" id="p33">The standard works of the Church are 
your basic sources for teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. You
 may also use the words of living prophets. There are many reasons why 
it is vital to use the scriptures as the basis for your teaching. For 
example:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199342" id="p34">The Lord and His prophets have instructed us to do so (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.12,56-58?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 42:12, 56–58</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/71.1?lang=eng#p1">71:1</a>).
 A latter-day prophet counseled, “The words and the way they are used in
 the Book of Mormon by the Lord … should be used by us in teaching 
gospel principles” (Ezra Taft Benson, “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1987/04/the-book-of-mormon-and-the-doctrine-and-covenants?lang=eng&amp;para=p23#p23">The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1987, 84).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199343" id="p35">The scriptures invite the Holy Ghost into your teaching. They teach God’s word with power (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.5?lang=eng#p5">Alma 31:5</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199345" id="p36">The scriptures answer the great questions of the soul (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3?lang=eng#p3">2&nbsp;Nephi 32:3</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.8?lang=eng#p8">Jacob 2:8</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199347" id="p37">The scriptures give authority and validity to your teaching, even in areas without a Christian background.</p>

<p data-aid="128199350" id="p38">Your ability to teach with power from 
the scriptures comes in large measure from the time you personally spend
 studying them. As you daily feast upon the word, your ability to teach 
from the scriptures will improve. In addition, your invitations to study
 and ponder the scriptures will be more powerful because you are doing 
the same thing in your life. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ 
through studying the scriptures—particularly the Book of Mormon—and to 
gain a testimony that the scriptures are sources of revealed truth. When
 people come to believe the scriptures, you will be better able to help 
them understand the doctrine correctly. The following suggestions may 
help.</p>
<p data-aid="128199352" id="p39"><strong>Introduce the scripture.</strong>
 Describe briefly the background and context of the passage you will 
use. Invite those you teach to look for particular points in the 
passage. When teaching people with a limited knowledge of the 
scriptures, you may need to begin by describing the contents of a 
passage, using language that they will understand. Below are examples of
 introducing a scripture:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199353" id="p40">“Here in Joseph Smith’s history we have
 Joseph’s own words telling what happened to him as he went into the 
grove to pray. He said, ‘I saw a pillar of light&nbsp;…’”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199355" id="p41">“In this passage the prophet Alma is 
teaching people who are poor to exercise their faith in the word of God.
 He compares the word of God to a seed that can be planted in our 
hearts. Will you begin reading verse&nbsp;…”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199357" id="p42"><strong>Read the passage.</strong> Read
 the verses aloud or ask the person you are teaching to read aloud. Be 
sensitive to those who struggle to read. If a passage is difficult for 
them to understand, read with them carefully and help them understand 
the more difficult points. Or give them a simpler passage to read. You 
might also define difficult words or phrases:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199358" id="p43"><span class="page-break" data-page="183"></span>“Let
 him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not 
[’upbraideth not’ means that God won’t find blame or fault] and it shall
 be given him” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/1.5?lang=eng#p5">James 1:5</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199360" id="p44">Some scriptural passages are clear and need no explanation. For others you may take time to explain what has been read.</p>
<p data-aid="128199361" id="p45"><strong>Apply the scripture.</strong> “Liken” the scriptures to yourself and to those you teach by showing how the principles are relevant today (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23?lang=eng#p23">1&nbsp;Nephi 19:23</a>).
 Show them how they can apply the principles in their lives. As they do,
 they will come to know that the doctrine is true. Bear your testimony 
of the principle, and promise them blessings. For example:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199363" id="p46">“The people of Alma, like you, had 
heavy burdens placed on them, almost more than they could bear. But as 
they exercised faith and ‘cried mightily to God,’ He strengthened them 
so they could endure the challenges and then delivered them from their 
trials. Just as He did with these people, I know God will help you in 
your trials as you&nbsp;…”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199365" id="p47">“Alma’s instruction to the people at the waters of Mormon applies to us today. John, are you willing to&nbsp;…”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199367" id="p48">The people you teach will differ widely
 in how they view sacred texts, how familiar they are with the Bible, 
how well they understand scriptural language, and how deeply they 
believe that the Bible contains God’s word. Help all people gain an 
appreciation for the scriptures. By effectively using the scriptures in 
your teaching, you can help them begin to study the scriptures on their 
own. After each visit, suggest specific chapters or verses for them to 
read. You might give them questions to consider as they read, which you 
can discuss in your next meeting. This will encourage them to study the 
scriptures daily in their homes and participate in Church meetings and 
classes where the scriptures are used.</p>

<p class="title" data-aid="128199368" id="figure10_title1">Cultural Views of Scriptures</p>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199370" id="figure10_p1">Most religions have sacred 
texts or books of scripture, but their use and perception of them may be
 different from how members of the Church view scriptures. For example, 
you may need to explain that your marking of scriptures is evidence of 
your desire to understand and apply the teachings of the scriptures and 
is not a sign of disrespect. Help those you teach see that the standard 
works are important because they contain the word of the Lord as written
 by prophets of God and that we accept them as truth.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128199396" id="p49">People are better able to believe the 
message of the Restoration of the gospel when they understand the 
message. President James&nbsp;E. Faust said: “Study, ponder, and teach 
from the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon and the New 
Testament. Know the truth so well that you can state it clearly. 
B.&nbsp;H. Roberts wrote, ‘To be known, the truth must be stated and the
 clearer and more complete the statement is, the better the opportunity 
will the Holy Spirit have for testifying to the souls of men that the 
work is true.’ [<cite>New Witnesses for God,</cite> 3 vols. (1909), 2:vii]. You cannot convert people beyond your own conversion” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1996/04/what-i-want-my-son-to-know-before-he-leaves-on-his-mission?lang=eng&amp;para=p27#p27">What I Want My Son to Know before He Leaves on His Mission</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 1996, 41).</p>
<p data-aid="128199398" id="p50">You are commanded to reason with and expound the scriptures when you teach (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.1?lang=eng#p1">Doctrine and Covenants 68:1</a>). <i>Expound</i>
 means to enlarge on and to explain clearly. Expounding the gospel means
 that you explain the meaning of the doctrine and scriptural passages 
simply and clearly, relying on the Spirit to guide what you say. Use 
dignified but conversational language to help people understand the 
doctrinal principles. Ask questions to help them think about the 
principles and to see if they understand and accept what you have 
taught.</p>
<p data-aid="128199400" id="p51">At the end of each of the first three 
lessons in chapter&nbsp;3 is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to 
those you teach. Part of teaching for understanding is to make sure you 
explain words, phrases, and ideas so that other people understand you 
better. You can improve your ability to explain the gospel by:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199401" id="p52">Understanding the words you use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199403" id="p53">Defining words others may not 
understand. Many words that mean special things to members of the Church
 are defined simply in approved Church resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199405" id="p54">Asking people questions like, “Do you 
know what we mean when we say&nbsp;…&nbsp;?” or “Can you restate what we
 just talked about in your own words?”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199407" id="p55">As you study the doctrine in 
chapter&nbsp;3, identify words you think may be difficult for someone to
 understand. As you teach the doctrine in chapter&nbsp;3, make notes of 
words, phrases, and ideas that those you teach have a hard time 
understanding. Define those words using the resources mentioned above. 
Test your definitions with people you are teaching and recent converts.</p>

<p data-aid="128199450" id="p56">Jesus Christ often asked questions to 
help people ponder and apply principles. His questions prompted thought,
 soul searching, and commitment.</p>
<p data-aid="128199451" id="p57">Good questions will help you understand
 interests, concerns, or questions that others have. They can enhance 
your teaching, invite the Spirit, and help people learn.</p>
<p data-aid="128199453" id="p58">Poor questions can intimidate, 
irritate, and offend people. They can also cause you to lose control of 
the teaching situation. Try to ask questions that:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199455" id="p59">Are simple and easy to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199456" id="p60">Help people think about what you are teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199457" id="p61">Help you determine how well they understand what you are teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199458" id="p62">Help people apply what they learn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199459" id="p63">As those you teach respond to these 
types of questions, they will feel that they can talk openly. Good 
questions can lead people to ask you questions when they don’t 
understand, when they have a concern, or when they want to know what to 
do. Good questions can help those you teach share their feelings and by 
so doing discover a growing testimony. Examples of effective questions 
include:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199460" id="p64">What questions do you have about what we have taught?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199461" id="p65">Do you believe that Heavenly Father loves you? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199462" id="p66">How do we sometimes make the same error as the people in this story?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199463" id="p67"><span class="page-break" data-page="186"></span>To
 help those you teach prepare to answer questions, you may want to say, 
“As I explain the importance of keeping the Sabbath day holy, ask 
yourself, ‘What does this commandment mean to me?’” Avoid asking 
questions that:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199464" id="p68">Include more than one idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199465" id="p69">Pertain to doctrine you have not yet taught.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199466" id="p70">Do not have a clear purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199467" id="p71">Interrogate and pry unnecessarily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128199468" id="p72">Asking too many questions, especially 
in your first visit, gives the impression that you are conducting an 
“interrogation.” Do not ask people to give specific answers about 
unimportant or obvious details. This will turn a good teaching 
environment into a game of guessing. When you need a specific answer, it
 is best to ask a factual question or present the information in some 
other way. Avoid asking questions that might embarrass someone if they 
do not know the answers. Questions are most useful when asked after you 
have taught and testified about a key principle. Following are examples 
of less-effective questions:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128199469" id="p73">Who was the first prophet? (Asked before teaching about dispensations.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199470" id="p74">How will keeping our bodies pure help 
us have the Spirit and show that we are willing to follow a prophet of 
God? (More than one idea.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199471" id="p75">Is it important to know about God’s commandments? (Yes-no answer and too obvious.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199472" id="p76">How do you feel about the Book of Mormon? (Before they have read it.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199473" id="p77">What is something we can do every day that will help us feel close to God? (Vague question looking for a specific answer: pray.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128199474" id="p78">Who was the next prophet after Noah? (Asking them to guess.)</p>

<p data-aid="128199476" id="p79">Learn to ask questions as prompted by 
the Spirit. The right type of question at the right time can greatly 
help those you teach to learn the gospel and feel the Spirit. Likewise, 
the wrong type of question or a question at the wrong time can interfere
 with their learning. Asking appropriate questions at the right time 
requires that you are in tune with the Spirit, that you listen to those 
you are teaching, and that you focus throughout the teaching experience.
 Effective teaching can be hard work and requires concentration and 
effort on the part of you and your companion.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128199484" id="title9"><span class="page-break" data-page="187"></span>Listen</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128199485" id="p80">When you listen carefully to others, 
you understand them better. When they know that their thoughts and 
feelings are important to you, they are more likely to be receptive to 
your teachings, share personal experiences, and make commitments. As you
 listen, you will be able to more effectively adapt your teaching to 
their needs and interests.</p>
<p data-aid="128199486" id="p81">Especially listen for the whisperings 
of the Spirit. As others share their feelings with you, thoughts or 
ideas may enter your mind that are directed by the Spirit. You will also
 be able to understand what others are trying to express.</p>
<p data-aid="128199487" id="p82">While others talk to you, avoid the 
tendency to think about what you are going to say. Make sure you are 
really concentrating on the person speaking rather than planning your 
response. Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland taught: “More important than 
speaking is listening. These people are not lifeless objects disguised 
as a baptismal statistic. They are children of God, our brothers and 
sisters, and they need what we have. Be genuine. Reach out sincerely. 
Ask these friends what matters most to <em>them.</em> What do <em>they</em> cherish, and what do <em>they</em>
 hold dear? And then listen. If the setting is right, you might ask what
 their fears are, what they yearn for, or what they feel is missing in 
their lives. I promise you that <em>something</em> in what they say will <em>always</em>
 highlight a truth of the gospel about which you can bear testimony and 
about which you can then offer more. … If we listen with love, we won’t 
need to wonder what to say. It will be given to us—by the Spirit and by 
our friends” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me?lang=eng&amp;para=p19#p19">Witnesses unto Me</a>,” <cite>Ensign,</cite> May 2001, 15; italics in original).</p>
<p data-aid="128199488" id="p83">People also communicate by the way they
 sit, their facial expressions, what they do with their hands, their 
tone of voice, and the movements of their eyes. Observe these unspoken 
messages; they can help you understand the feelings of those you teach. 
Also be aware of your own body language. Send a message of interest and 
enthusiasm by listening sincerely.</p>
<p data-aid="128199489" id="p84">Do not be afraid of silence. People 
often need time to think about and reply to questions or to express what
 they are feeling. You might pause after you have asked a question, 
after sharing a spiritual experience, or when people are having 
difficulty expressing themselves. Be sure to give people time to 
complete their thoughts before you respond, and do not interrupt while 
they are talking.</p>
<p data-aid="128199490" id="p85">When you feel that you understand what 
is being said, make comments that show you understand, such as “So what 
you are saying is _____. Is that right?” or “If I understand, you are 
feeling that _____.” When you are not sure if you understand, ask the 
person for clarification.</p>
<p data-aid="128199491" id="p86">Some people may tend to dominate the 
conversation and keep you from teaching the restored gospel. You will 
need to learn to take control of such situations tactfully. For example,
 “We appreciate what you are sharing with us, but that is an issue we 
would like to discuss later. I will ask my companion to write it down so
 we will be sure not to forget to treat it on a later visit.” Remember, 
you will help people most by teaching them the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="128199492" id="p87">As you listen carefully, the Spirit 
will help you know what to say. Listening takes effort and 
concentration. One missionary shared the following true experience (the 
names have been changed):</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-aid="128199493" id="p88">My companion and I were teaching the 
Sanchez family. It was hot and the children were making a lot of noise. I
 asked Sister Sanchez about her reading in the Book of Mormon. As she 
began to explain, I noticed that their son had grabbed my companion’s 
notebook and was running around the room waving it in the air. Although I
 was looking at Sister Sanchez, my mind was elsewhere. I thought to 
myself, <span class="page-break" data-page="188"></span>“It’s so hot, 
and I wish their little boy would settle down. This just isn’t going to 
work.” As my mind wandered, I noticed that Sister Sanchez was struggling
 to talk. A subtle impression came into my mind to listen. I fought to 
tune out the heat and the noise. I carefully watched her face as she 
spoke. She looked down at the ground, then back up at my companion and 
me. Her husband was hopelessly trying to quiet the children. There was a
 pause, and then with trembling in her voice she said, “I did what you 
asked. I read those chapters you wanted me to, and I prayed.” Again she 
paused and looked down. She glanced at her children, then her eyes met 
mine. “I got an answer,” she said with a smile and with tear-filled 
eyes. “It’s true, I know it’s true.” The Spirit filled the room. With a 
heart full of gratitude that I had listened, I smiled and said, “Yes, it
 is.”</p>

<p data-aid="128199516" id="p89">Some of those you teach will lack the 
faith to keep commitments, others will face opposition, and others will 
not always accept everything you share. They must make their own 
choices, but you will want to do all you can to answer their questions, 
help them resolve their concerns, and overcome opposition.</p>
<p data-aid="128199517" id="p90">Sometimes people’s concerns are like an
 iceberg. Only a small portion is visible above the surface. These 
concerns can be complex and difficult to resolve. For this reason, you 
need to follow the Spirit and respond in a manner best suited to the 
situation. <span class="page-break" data-page="189"></span>Pray for the 
gift of discernment and follow your impressions. Heavenly Father knows 
the hearts and experiences of all people (the complete iceberg) and will
 help you know what is best for each person.</p>
<p data-aid="128200182" id="p91">When you help others resolve their 
concerns, first seek to understand their concerns by asking questions 
and listening. Rely on the Spirit to help you know how to help them 
resolve their concerns. For example, you might use a scripture to 
address a concern about the need for baptism, or you might share your 
testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
<p data-aid="128200184" id="p92">Often concerns are more social than 
doctrinal. For example, some people might fear opposition from family 
members if they join the Church. Or they might fear rejection from their
 friends at work. Whatever the concern may be, they may have past 
experiences or other influences that are part of the concern that you do
 not understand. In many cases, members may be able to help you 
understand and help with their concerns.</p>
<p data-aid="128200186" id="p93">How you approach an individual’s 
concern will depend on the nature of that concern. Determine whether the
 concern has come up because the person does not have a spiritual 
confirmation of the truth of the Restoration or whether the person does 
not want to commit to living a true principle. Understanding the source 
of the problem in this way helps you know whether to focus on testimony 
or commitment.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128200191" id="title11">Repentance and Addiction Recovery</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128200193" id="p94">Repentance is a spiritual process that 
involves humility, confession, restitution, and turning away from the 
sin. It is a continual commitment to improve our thoughts and actions as
 we work to become more like the Savior. Even when sins are repeated, 
repentance is available as a means of healing (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.30?lang=eng#p30">Mosiah 26:30</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.8?lang=eng#p8">Moroni 6:8</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.31-32?lang=eng#p31">Doctrine and Covenants 1:31–32</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200195" id="p95">Repentance may involve an emotional and
 physical process. People must stop ongoing, ingrained ways of 
inappropriate acting. Undesirable actions must be replaced with healthy 
and appropriate behaviors.</p>
<p data-aid="128200196" id="p96">Sometimes converts, even with the best 
of intentions, give in to temptation as they progress toward greater 
self-discipline. Thus, both repentance and recovery may take 
considerable time. In such cases new converts seek the Lord’s help, and 
if necessary, work with their priesthood leaders (not with the 
missionaries) as they seek to overcome temptation and to fully repent.</p>
<p data-aid="128200198" id="p97">Through baptism and confirmation people
 receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which will strengthen their ability
 to overcome these challenges. But baptism and confirmation may not 
fully do away with the emotional and physical urges that go along with 
these behaviors. Even though a person may have some initial success, 
further emotional healing may be necessary to completely repent and 
recover.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128200211" id="p98">You may be asked to answer questions 
and concerns about addiction. You may also want to help people find 
answers to difficult questions related to these problems. The best thing
 you can do is to refer them to local priesthood leaders and encourage 
them to become familiar with the Church’s online Addiction Recovery 
Program. You may also want to encourage local Church leaders to access 
this same resource. Local leaders can also refer to the Church’s 
Provident Living website.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128200214" id="p99">Reinforce their efforts to come unto 
Christ. Help them see that their efforts to recover and heal are

can be strengthened through the Savior and His Atonement. He fully 
recognizes the intent of their heart to do good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200216" id="p100">Pray for them both in your personal 
prayers and in your prayers with them. As appropriate, encourage them to
 seek a priesthood blessing from local priesthood leaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200218" id="p101">Continue teaching them the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. Teach them that Heavenly Father, the Savior, and the Holy

<p data-aid="128200263" id="p119">Latter-day Saints can best help new 
members remain active by being their friends. Members should reach out 
to those you are teaching and to new converts with a warm, positive 
attitude. Visitors and new converts will often respond favorably when 
greeted with a smile, when sincerely asked about how they are doing, 
when others sit by them during meetings, and when they are invited to a 
family dinner or home evening.</p>
<p data-aid="128200266" id="p120">Because it is likely that some people may return to an addiction, priesthood leaders and members <span class="page-break" data-page="191"></span>should
 not be shocked or discouraged if they learn that someone you are 
teaching or a new member may be struggling with such problems. They 
should show love toward the individual and not be judgmental if the 
person yields to an old craving. They should treat it as a temporary and
 understandable setback. Condemning the person being taught or the new 
convert is never helpful and may lead to discouragement, feelings of 
failure, and inactivity. A new convert who suddenly stops attending 
church may have given in to an old addiction and may be feeling unworthy
 and discouraged. An immediate visit giving encouragement and support 
can help the person succeed. Members should show in word and action that
 the Church is a place where the love of Christ can be found (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.32?lang=eng#p32">3&nbsp;Nephi 18:32</a>).
 Elder Dale&nbsp;G. Renlund has counseled, “We must not only be tolerant
 while others work on their individual illnesses; we must also be kind, 
patient, supportive, and understanding” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/04/latter-day-saints-keep-on-trying?lang=eng&amp;para=p17#p17">Latter-day Saints Keep on Trying</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> May 2015, 57).</p>
<p data-aid="128200269" id="p121">Remaining active in the Church and 
striving to live faithfully are important things people can do as they 
work to overcome addiction.</p>

the Book of Mormon to study or encourage them to use approved Church 
resources (both print and digital), such as Gospel Library, to find 
answers to a concern, research a topic, or watch a video. The people you
 teach should always be given something to think about, to ponder, and 
to pray about. This can become an opening topic of discussion the next

</header>
<p data-aid="128200293" id="p123">Some of the people whom you will teach
 may not believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ or have a Christian
 tradition. Many of these people, however, will have beliefs, practices,
 and places which they hold sacred. As a servant of God, it is essential
 that you show proper respect for their religious beliefs and 
traditions. Do not do anything that would show disrespect for that which
 is important to them.</p>
<p data-aid="128200296" id="p124"><span class="page-break" data-page="192"></span>You
 may wonder how you should adjust your teaching approach for these 
people. It will be helpful to remember that in order to be converted, 
all of God’s children, regardless of background, must develop faith in 
Jesus Christ, repent, receive the ordinances of baptism and 
confirmation, and endure to the end by keeping the commandments and 
giving service. The principles that help others build faith in Jesus 
Christ are the same in all cultures. You can find valuable resources for
 teaching those without a Christian background in Gospel Library under 
the “Missionary” section.</p>
<p data-aid="128200299" id="p125">You can help people gain a correct 
understanding of God as our Heavenly Father and develop faith in Jesus 
Christ by helping them have personal spiritual experiences rather than 
simply telling them about the nature of God. For example, you will help 
people gain this understanding as they:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128200302" id="p126">Gain a spiritual conviction that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200304" id="p127">Hear your sincere teaching and testimony of the gospel, including why you chose to follow Jesus Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200307" id="p128">Frequently hear you and other members talk to Heavenly Father in a simple, heartfelt prayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200310" id="p129">Hear you bear powerful testimony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200312" id="p130">Pray with you and on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200315" id="p131">Come to learn how you feel about the scriptures as you read and discuss them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200318" id="p132">Read God’s word from the scriptures daily (especially the Book of Mormon).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200321" id="p133">Attend church so they can see how we worship the Lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200323" id="p134">Meet members of the Church who can explain how they came to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200326" id="p135">Keep the commandments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128200329" id="p136">These activities are beneficial for 
all people you teach, but they are essential when teaching those without
 a Christian background because these people are less likely to have had
 these experiences previously.</p>
<p data-aid="128200331" id="p137">Many converts from non-Christian 
backgrounds report that they did not understand much of what the 
missionaries were saying but that they felt the Spirit and wanted to do 
what the missionaries asked. Do all you can to help people understand 
the doctrine of the gospel. Be patient and supportive, as it may take 
some time for people to learn to identify and express the feelings they 
have inside. You may need to adjust the pace and depth of your teaching 
to help them understand. As you prepare to teach those without a 
Christian background, the following suggestions may help:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128200334" id="p138">Provide simple overviews and reviews for each lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200337" id="p139">Ask them to tell you what they understand and what they have experienced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200340" id="p140">Take the time to define essential 
words and principles. Those you teach may not be familiar with many of 
the words you will use as you teach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128200342" id="p141">Return to a previously taught lesson to teach the doctrine more clearly. This may be necessary any time in the teaching process.</p>

<p data-aid="128200367" id="figure25_p1">When possible, identify a 
convert who was not part of a Christian tradition before meeting with 
the missionaries. Arrange to meet with him or her, and ask about his or 
her conversion experience. For example, you might ask what led the 
person to believe in God, the first time he or she prayed, the first 
time he or she felt an answer to prayer, the role of the scriptures in 
his or her conversion, and what it was like to attend Sunday services.

<p data-aid="128200438" id="p159">“Now you as teachers are not being 
sent out to teach new doctrine. You’re to teach the old [doctrine], not 
so plain that they can just understand, but you must teach the 
[doctrine] of the Church so plainly that no one can misunderstand” (<cite>The Teachings of Harold&nbsp;B. Lee,</cite> 458).</p>
