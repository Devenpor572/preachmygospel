<p data-aid="128200955" id="p1">The Lord has said, “Seek not to declare 
my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be
 loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea,
 the power of God unto the convincing of men” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.21?lang=eng#p21">Doctrine and Covenants 11:21</a>).
 To teach effectively, you need to obtain spiritual knowledge. For you 
to grow in the gospel and stay on the path that leads to eternal life, 
you need to develop a habit of gospel study (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.6?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 131:6</a>).
 The study habits you develop as a missionary will bless you personally 
and help those you teach grow in their faith in the Savior.</p>
<p data-aid="128200956" id="p2">Effective daily study should begin with 
prayer. Study is an act of faith requiring the use of personal agency. 
Many missionaries struggle to know how to study effectively. Some rely 
heavily on others or on structured programs to tell them what and how to
 study. While learning from a good teacher is very important, it is more
 important for you to have meaningful learning experiences on your own. 
Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire 
to learn, studying with “real intent” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4?lang=eng#p4">Moroni 10:4</a>), “hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after righteousness” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.6?lang=eng#p6">Matthew 5:6</a>), and searching for answers to the questions and concerns of those you are teaching.</p>

<p data-aid="128200970" id="p3">Your gospel study is most effective when
 you are taught by the Holy Ghost. Always begin your gospel study by 
praying for the Holy Ghost to help you learn. He will bring knowledge 
and conviction that will bless your life and allow you to bless the 
lives of others. Your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. Your desire 
to repent and improve will grow.</p>
<p data-aid="128200971" id="p4">This kind of study prepares you for 
service, offers solace, resolves problems, and gives you the strength to
 endure to the end. Successful gospel study requires desire and action. 
“For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God 
shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in 
these times as in times of old” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.19?lang=eng#p19">1&nbsp;Nephi 10:19</a>). Like Enos, as you hunger to know the words of eternal life and as you allow these words to “[sink] deep into [your] heart” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.3?lang=eng#p3">Enos 1:3</a>), the Holy Ghost will open your mind and heart to greater light and understanding.</p>
<p data-aid="128200972" id="p5">Learning the gospel is also a process of receiving revelation (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.8?lang=eng#p8">Jacob 4:8</a>).
 To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said: “Behold, you have not understood; you 
have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought 
save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study 
it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is 
right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you
 shall feel that it is right” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.7-8?lang=eng#p7">Doctrine and Covenants 9:7–8</a>).
 As you study, pay careful attention to ideas that come to your mind and
 feelings that come to your heart, particularly regarding the people you
 are teaching.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202051" id="p20"><strong>Focus on commitments and baptismal interview questions.</strong> Teach so that people will make commitments and prepare for baptism and confirmation. Make sure you understand the <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-2-the-plan-of-salvation?lang=eng">baptismal interview questions and commitments</a>
 for each lesson. Learn what someone should know, feel, and do because 
of your teaching. Work with your companion to explain these principles 
in your own words with clarity and power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202052" id="p21"><strong>Learn and apply the doctrine.</strong>
 The doctrine is the foundation of the lesson. Prayerfully study the 
scriptures, lessons, and other approved resources to gain a solid 
understanding of the doctrine. Search for material that supports the 
doctrine of the lessons. Commit to memory the sequence of doctrinal 
principles. Apply what you learn. Record what you learn in your study 
journal. Share what you learn with other missionaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202053" id="p22"><strong>Organize and summarize what to teach.</strong>
 To prepare to teach the doctrine clearly and with spiritual power, 
organize and summarize what you will teach into a lesson plan. Focus on 
the doctrine, baptismal interview questions, and commitments of the 
lessons. Enhance your lesson plan with scriptures, questions, examples, 
and appropriate and approved media. These should vary according to the 
length of your teaching appointments. You should not create an entirely 
new lesson plan for each person you teach, but you should continually 
refine your lesson plans and modify them to meet specific needs. When 
you are first creating a lesson plan, strive to be simple and brief. 
Enhance your lesson plans as you gain experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202054" id="p23"><strong>Focus on needs.</strong> While 
the doctrine of the gospel applies to everyone, you should adjust your 
teaching approach to meet the needs of those you teach. As you study 
doctrine and create lesson plans, identify areas where you can adjust 
your approach to meet potential needs. Review and refine these 
adjustments as you prepare for specific appointments. Identify the 
invitations you will extend. Focus on the ultimate goal of helping those
 you teach receive the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through baptism 
and confirmation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202055" id="p24"><strong>Prepare to answer questions.</strong>
 As a missionary, you will hear many questions. Record these questions 
in your study journal. Search the scriptures and other approved 
resources for answers. Pray for understanding. Record the answers in 
your study journal. Review what you find with other missionaries. Add 
frequent questions and their answers to your study journal for 
reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202056" id="p25"><span class="page-break" data-page="21"></span><strong>Teach the lesson.</strong>
 Teaching is a powerful opportunity to improve your knowledge and 
ability. As you learn the doctrine and organize lesson plans, teach your
 companion and other missionaries. Try new explanations, approaches, 
experiences, questions, and ways to invite others to make commitments. 
Ask for ideas and suggestions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202057" id="p26"><strong>Evaluate your teaching.</strong>
 After every teaching situation, evaluate the experience. Did you focus 
on the doctrine? Is their faith in Christ and His Atonement growing? Did
 you invite them to repent and to make and keep commitments? Did you 
teach them how to pray and study the scriptures? Are they praying, 
studying the Book of Mormon, and attending church? Did you work to 
prepare them for baptism and confirmation? Did you use effective 
questions? Did you share your testimony? Did you ask for referrals? 
Adjust your lesson plans as you improve.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128202058" id="p27">As you learn the lessons, continue 
seeking a deep knowledge of the doctrine. Actively work to teach with 
greater power. As you study in prayer and faith, your knowledge and 
testimony will grow. However, do not try to teach all that you know. 
Teach the message clearly, simply, and based on individual needs, 
following the Spirit to teach “that portion that shall be meted unto 
every man” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85?lang=eng#p85">Doctrine and Covenants 84:85</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128202060" id="p28">We have a powerful message with a 
unique vocabulary. Just as a physician speaks differently in the family 
waiting room than in the operating room, so too must you learn to speak 
so that those who are unfamiliar with our message can understand what 
you are teaching.</p>
<p data-aid="128202061" id="p29">To prepare to help others understand 
unfamiliar words, study the list of key definitions and terms in the 
“Ideas for Teaching” section of each applicable lesson. Become familiar 
with the definitions provided. Use approved resources to find 
definitions for other words. Write these definitions in your study 
journal. Share the definitions with your companion and others to see if 
you understand. If the definitions are unclear to others, revise your 
definitions based on the material you have studied.</p>
<p data-aid="128202062" id="p30">As you teach, seek to discern whether a
 word or principle is new to the person you are teaching. Take time to 
explain unfamiliar words or principles. Remember to teach for 
understanding so that you and those you teach “are edified and rejoice 
together” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.22?lang=eng#p22">Doctrine and Covenants 50:22</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128202119" id="p67">Marking or annotating your scriptures 
can assist you in thinking deeply about a passage or doctrine of the 
gospel. You can mark your scriptures in many ways. Find a method that 
works for you. Below are some guidelines for marking a printed version 
of the scriptures.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128202120" id="p68">Use pencils or colored markers. Avoid using pens that bleed through the paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202121" id="p69">Shade, underline, bracket, or outline part of a verse, an entire verse, or a group of verses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202122" id="p70">Avoid excessive marking. The benefit is
 lost if you cannot understand your markings because you have made too 
many notes, lines, and colors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202123" id="p71">Underline only a few key words to highlight the verse, section, or chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202124" id="p72">Circle or underline key words, and then use straight lines to link closely related words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202125" id="p73">When a series of points in a verse or passage are related, number the points in the margin or text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202126" id="p74">Use the footnotes as a resource for marking and interpreting the scriptures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128202127" id="p75">Place a symbol (such as a check mark) in the margin for key verses you feel are critical to remember.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128202128" id="p76">Marking your scriptures should help you
 focus on applying what you learn and on teaching others. Develop an 
approach that is consistent and helps you accomplish your purpose as a 
missionary.</p>
