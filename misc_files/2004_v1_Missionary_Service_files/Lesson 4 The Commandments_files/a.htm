</header>
<p data-aid="128201581" id="figure1_p1">There are many ways to teach the
 commandments found in this lesson. For example, you might teach a few 
of the commandments from this lesson as part of the first three lessons,
 or you might teach several commandments as a single lesson. What you do
 should be determined by the needs of those you are teaching and 
direction from the Spirit.</p>

<header>
<h2 data-aid="128201584" id="title2">Prepare to Teach</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128201586" id="p1">Your purpose in teaching the 
commandments is to help people live the gospel by exercising faith in 
Jesus Christ and repenting as they prepare for baptism and confirmation 
and to help them remain faithful after baptism. Help those you teach 
understand that enduring to the end includes keeping the commandments of
 God. By obeying the commandments, people will grow in their testimony 
of the gospel, show that they have “broken hearts and contrite spirits,”
 and begin to repent of all their sins (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.1-4?lang=eng#p1">Moroni 6:1–4</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128201589" id="p2">This lesson is organized differently 
from the first three. The first three lessons explain the doctrinal 
foundation for the gospel of Jesus Christ. This lesson explains specific
 commandments God has given that help us apply gospel principles in our 
lives.</p>
<p data-aid="128201591" id="p3">There are many ways to teach this 
lesson. The approach you take should be determined by the needs, 
interests, and situation of the people you teach and the direction of 
the Spirit. Prayerfully decide what to teach and which invitations to 
extend. Be mindful of the questions and level of understanding of those 
you teach.</p>
<p data-aid="137202557" id="p62">Constantly think and pray about how to help them live the gospel. Ideas include:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128201594" id="p4">Teaching one or more commandments as part of another lesson. When doing so, consider the principle taught in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.32?lang=eng#p32">Alma 12:32</a>: “God gave unto them commandments, <em>after</em>
 having made known unto them the plan of redemption” (italics added). 
Certain commandments, such as prayer and scripture study, might be 
taught best as part of the first three lessons. Other commandments might
 be best taught after you have laid the doctrinal foundation of the 
gospel found in the first three lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201596" id="p5">Teaching two or three of the commandments as a single lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201599" id="p6">Teaching a single commandment as a lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128201601" id="p7">Teaching the commandments in the context
 of the gospel. Briefly review the lesson on the gospel of Jesus Christ 
before teaching one or more of the commandments. As you do so, you can 
help people see how the commandments fit into the larger picture of 
exercising faith in the Savior and repenting in preparation for baptism 
and confirmation. Their lives can be blessed as they see the gospel of 
Jesus Christ as a pattern for living.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128201603" id="p8">You may be able to teach some people in a
 few visits; others may require more visits. You have the flexibility to
 teach the lessons in whatever way best helps people fully prepare for 
their baptism and confirmation. Your purpose is not only to cover the 
material; it is to help others come unto Christ through faith in Jesus 
Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and 
enduring to the end.</p>
<p data-aid="128201606" id="p9">Rarely should a lesson go over 45 
minutes. You may find that time may only allow shorter teaching visits. 
In this case, you may need frequent, short teaching visits covering 
smaller portions of material.</p>
<p data-aid="128201608" id="p10">There are many ways you may approach 
teaching this lesson. Which commandment you teach, when you teach it, 
and how much time you give to it is best determined by the needs of the 
people you teach and the direction of the Spirit.</p>

<p data-aid="128201616" id="p12">Study the section that describes the commandment and write a simple lesson plan with three to five main points.</p>
</li>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201625" id="p15">God gives us commandments for our 
benefit. They are instructions from a loving Father in Heaven to help us
 have happy lives. He also gives us agency, or the ability and 
opportunity to choose between good and evil. When we obey God, we follow
 the influence of the Spirit and choose to conform to His will. 
Obedience to the commandments brings us peace in this life and eternal 
life and exaltation in the world to come. Obedience shows our love for 
God. Disobedience brings us sorrow.</p>
<p data-aid="128201628" id="p16">Heavenly Father knows our weaknesses 
and is patient with us. He blesses us as we rely upon His Son and strive
 to obey His commandments. He expects us to obey Him so He can bless us.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128201662" id="title5">Pray Often</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128201664" id="p17">God commands us to pray to Him. You can
 pray at any time and in any setting. The Lord has taught us to kneel 
and pray in the morning and in the evening, as individuals and with our 
families. Our Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. Through 
daily prayer we receive divine guidance and blessings. We should always 
pray sincerely. We should also pray with “real intent,” which means we 
are committed to act on the answer that we receive.</p>
<p data-aid="128201666" id="p18">We pray with faith to our Father in Heaven in the name of Jesus Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.8?lang=eng#p8">Moses 5:8</a>).
 Because He is our Father and we are His children, He will answer our 
prayers. We begin our prayers by addressing our Father in Heaven. We end
 our prayers by saying, “In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.”</p>
<p data-aid="128201669" id="p19">In prayer we speak openly and honestly 
with our loving Father in Heaven. We express gratitude and thanksgiving 
for our blessings. We may acknowledge our love for Him. We also ask for 
help, protection, and direction according to our needs.</p>
<p data-aid="128201671" id="p20">As we pray with faith, sincerity, and 
real intent, we will see God’s influence in our lives. He will guide us 
in our daily lives and help us make good decisions. He will bless us 
with feelings of comfort and peace. He will warn us of danger and 
strengthen us to resist temptation. He will forgive our sins. We will 
feel closer to Him. We must learn to recognize His influence in our 
lives. We must learn to listen to the still, small voice of the Spirit.</p>
<p data-aid="128201674" id="p21">We can recognize when the Holy Ghost is
 teaching us the truth. Our minds will be filled with inspiring and 
uplifting thoughts. We will be enlightened, or given new knowledge. Our 
hearts will have feelings of peace, joy, and love. We will want to do 
good and be helpful to others. These feelings are hard to describe but 
can be recognized as we experience them.</p>

<p data-aid="128201689" id="p22">The scriptures are written records of 
God’s dealings with His children as recorded by prophets under the 
guidance of the Holy Ghost. We show our faith by studying, believing, 
and obeying God’s revealed word. We diligently search the scriptures to 
understand the truth. We feast upon them because they open the door to 
revelation and show us what we need to do and become. We search the 
scriptures to learn about Jesus Christ and His gospel. Faith in Jesus 
Christ is a gift from God and comes through studying and living His word
 and His gospel. The approved scriptures of the Church, also called the 
standard works, are the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and
 Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. We should study these sacred 
books, especially the Book of Mormon, daily. The Book of Mormon 
testifies of Jesus Christ and the truthfulness of His doctrine.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128201704" id="title7">Keep the Sabbath Day Holy</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128201705" id="p23">Keeping the Sabbath day holy is a commandment. God declared, “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/20.8?lang=eng#p8">Exodus 20:8</a>).
 Our Sabbath-day behavior is a reflection of our commitment to honor and
 worship God. By keeping the Sabbath day holy, we show God our 
willingness to keep our covenants. Each Sabbath day we go to church to 
worship Him. While at church, members of the Church partake of the 
sacrament to remember Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Partaking of the 
sacrament allows us to renew our covenants and show that we are willing 
to repent of our sins and mistakes.</p>
<p data-aid="128201706" id="p24">On the Sabbath day, we enjoy a rest 
from our labors. As we attend Church services and worship together, we 
strengthen each other. We are renewed by our association with friends 
and family. Our faith is strengthened as we study the scriptures and 
learn more about the restored gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="128201707" id="p25">When a community or nation grows 
careless in its Sabbath activities, its religious life decays and all 
aspects of life are negatively affected. The blessings associated with 
keeping the Sabbath day holy are withheld. We should refrain from 
shopping on the Sabbath and participating in other commercial and 
sporting activities that make the Sabbath feel common.</p>
<p data-aid="128201708" id="p26">Instead, we should set this holy day 
apart from activities of the world by entering into a spirit of worship,
 thanksgiving, service, and activities with family and friends that are 
appropriate to the Sabbath. As Church members endeavor to make their 
Sabbath activities compatible with the intent and Spirit of the Lord, 
their lives will be filled with joy and peace. When we keep the Sabbath 
day holy, it becomes “a delight” (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/58.13-14?lang=eng#p13">Isaiah 58:13–14</a>), a time of spiritual refreshment (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/31.17?lang=eng#p17">Exodus 31:17</a>), and a sign of our love for and devotion to our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201733" id="p28">Truth is a knowledge of things as they 
really are, were, and will be. It does not change with conditions or 
time. Truth is the same in every age and culture. God is the source of 
all truth. We can have faith in Him because we know He will teach us 
only truth. God wants all His children to know the truth. Therefore, He 
reveals the truths necessary for salvation through prophets and 
apostles. He reveals truth to us personally through the scriptures and 
personal revelation.</p>
<p data-aid="128201734" id="p29">A prophet is called and chosen by God 
and is a righteous man with great faith. The Lord reveals truth to him 
through the Holy Ghost. He commands His prophet to teach truth to all 
people. Those who believe God’s words as revealed through His prophet 
are blessed.</p>
<p data-aid="128201735" id="p30">Christ’s Church is built on the 
foundation of apostles and prophets, who direct the Church by 
revelation. The Lord called Joseph Smith as the first prophet and head 
of this last dispensation. His successors who lead The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints today are also prophets and apostles. The 
President of the Church today is a living prophet. We are to have faith 
in God’s chosen prophet, gain conviction of his divine calling, and 
follow his teachings.</p>
<p data-aid="128201736" id="p31">We have frequent opportunities to sustain Church leaders publicly. To <i>sustain</i>
 means to offer our support with thoughts, words, and actions. We are to
 prepare ourselves so that when the prophets and apostles speak, the 
Holy Ghost can confirm the truths they teach, and we can then determine 
to follow the counsel they give us.</p>
<p data-aid="128201737" id="p32">Those who listen to and follow the 
counsel of living prophets and apostles will not go astray. The 
teachings of living prophets provide an anchor of eternal truth in a 
world of shifting values and help us avoid misery and sorrow. The 
confusion and strife of the world will not overwhelm us, and we can 
enjoy the assurance of being in harmony with God’s will.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128201780" id="title11">Live the Law of Chastity</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128201781" id="p45">God delights in chastity. Chastity 
means limiting all sexual relations to one husband (for women) or one 
wife (for men). It also means strict abstinence from sexual relations 
before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one’s spouse after 
marriage. Those who live the law of chastity enjoy the strength that 
comes from self-control. They enjoy confidence and trust in their family
 relationships. They can enjoy more fully the influence of the Holy 
Ghost in their lives. Those who break this law are subject to a lasting 
sense of shame and guilt that burdens their lives.</p>
<p data-aid="128201782" id="p46">Chastity requires faithfulness in 
thought and action. We must keep our thoughts clean and be modest in our
 dress, speech, and actions. We must avoid pornography in any form. We 
should treat the God-given procreative power and our bodies as sacred. 
Sexual relations are a God-given power to procreate and strengthen a 
married couple’s bond.</p>
<p data-aid="137202558" id="p60">People who experience same-sex 
attraction should also keep the law of chastity and keep covenants with 
God. Experiencing same-sex attraction or identifying as gay, lesbian, or
 bisexual is not a sin and does not prohibit one from participating in 
the Church, holding callings, or attending the temple.</p>
<p data-aid="137202559" id="p61">Baptismal candidates are to live the 
law of chastity, which prohibits any sexual relations outside of a legal
 marriage between one man and one woman. They are not to participate in 
abortions or homosexual relations. Because God loves all His children 
and reaches out to them in love through Jesus Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/5.8?lang=eng#p8">Romans 5:8</a>), those who have committed sexual sin can repent, be forgiven, and live after the manner of happiness (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.27?lang=eng#p27">2&nbsp;Nephi 5:27</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201784" id="figure18_p1">Men and women who are living 
together but are not married may not be baptized without first getting 
married or separated. People in same-sex marriages or same-sex 
relationships, or those who are married to more than one person at a 
time, may not be baptized. The invitation to live the law of chastity 
may pose very difficult challenges to the people you are teaching. Be 
prayerful and sensitive to each person’s situation. Use caution and 
follow the promptings of the Spirit when discussing sexual behavior to 
avoid compromising situations or accusations. Seek counsel from your 
mission president, who will give you specific direction in each case.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128201801" id="p47">The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph
 Smith a law of health called the Word of Wisdom. This law teaches us 
what foods and substances we should and should not use to maintain the 
health of our bodies and to keep us free from evil influences. The Lord 
promises blessings of health, strength, protection against evil, and 
greater receptiveness to spiritual truths.</p>
<p data-aid="128201802" id="p48">Remember that our bodies are sacred. We
 should treat them with respect and reverence. The Word of Wisdom 
teaches that we are to eat healthy foods. It teaches very specifically 
that we are to avoid harmful substances, including alcohol, tobacco, 
tea, and coffee. We must also avoid harmful drugs in any form. To be 
baptized and confirmed, those you teach must give up these substances. 
People who obey the Word of Wisdom are more receptive to spiritual 
truths.</p>
<p data-aid="128201803" id="p49">Your mission president will answer 
questions about whether other specific substances in your culture are 
included in the Word of Wisdom.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128204822" id="title13">Keep the Law of Tithing</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128204823" id="p50">One of the great blessings of 
membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the 
privilege of contributing to the growth of the kingdom of God through 
paying tithing. Tithing is an ancient, divine law. For example, the Old 
Testament prophet Abraham paid tithes of all he possessed (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.15?lang=eng#p15">Alma 13:15</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128204824" id="p51">To those who pay tithing, the Lord 
promises that He will “open … the windows of heaven, and pour … out a 
blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10?lang=eng#p10">Malachi 3:10</a>). These blessings may be temporal or spiritual, but they will come to those who obey this divine law.</p>
<p data-aid="128204825" id="p52">Tithing means one-tenth, and the Lord 
has commanded us to give a tenth of our increase, which is understood to
 mean income, that we may be blessed. The law of tithing gives us the 
opportunity to help build His kingdom. Our tithes are holy to the Lord, 
and we honor Him by paying tithing. God promises to abundantly bless 
those who pay an honest tithe. Those who do not pay tithing rob God (see
 <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3.8?lang=eng#p8">Malachi 3:8</a>).
 They keep for themselves something that rightfully belongs to Him. We 
should seek first the kingdom of God, and tithing is an important way of
 doing that. Paying tithing is an expression of our faith. It is an 
outward sign of our belief in God and His work.</p>
<p data-aid="128204826" id="p53">Tithing funds are used to support the 
ongoing activities of the Church, such as building and maintaining 
temples and meetinghouses, carrying the gospel to all the world, 
conducting temple and family history service, and many other worldwide 
activities. Tithing does not pay local Church leaders, who serve 
voluntarily without receiving payment of any kind.</p>
<p data-aid="128204827" id="p54">Local Church leaders send the tithing 
received each week directly to Church headquarters. A council comprised 
of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding 
Bishopric determines specific ways to use the sacred tithing funds.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128204843" id="title14">Observe the Law of the Fast</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128204844" id="p55">Great blessings are available to those 
who obey God’s commandment to fast. Fasting means going without food and
 drink for a period of time. Usually the first Sunday of each month is 
set aside as a special day to fast for two consecutive meals, pray, and 
bear testimony. Fasting and prayer go together. When we fast and pray 
with faith, we are more receptive to receiving answers to our prayers 
and blessings from the Lord. He promises us that He will guide us 
continually. We should fast and pray for specific purposes. Fasting is 
private and spiritual, and we should not draw attention to the fact that
 we are fasting.</p>
<p data-aid="128204845" id="p56">Pure religion includes caring for the 
poor. We are to help them meet their physical and spiritual needs. When 
we fast, we donate money to the Church for the care of the poor and the 
needy. We call this a fast offering. We give at least the amount of 
money we save by fasting for two meals. However, we need not limit our 
contribution to the cost of two meals. We are encouraged to be as 
generous as our means allow. By caring for the poor, we help fulfill our
 baptismal covenant and retain a remission of our sins.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128204868" id="p57">Tithes and offerings are paid 
voluntarily and privately. Members are encouraged to pay tithes as they 
receive their income. However, members who wish to pay annually may do 
so. Members may contribute fast-offering funds directly to a member of 
the bishopric or to an Aaronic Priesthood holder designated to receive 
fast-offering donations. Members make donations by completing a donation
 slip, which is obtained from the bishopric. (Tithing donations, as 
opposed to fast offerings, should be given only to a member of the 
bishopric.) The member keeps the yellow copy and seals the white copy 
and the donation in an envelope that is provided. The envelope is given 
to a member of the bishopric. Members may also make donations online 
using their private Church account. These donations are considered 
sacred and belong to the Lord. A member of the bishopric and a clerk 
keep a careful, confidential accounting of all donations.</p>
<p data-aid="128204869" id="p58">Members attend tithing settlement with 
the bishop at the end of each year to declare their tithing 
faithfulness. At this private meeting, members receive a year-end report
 of all their donations. All financial information is kept strictly 
confidential.</p>
