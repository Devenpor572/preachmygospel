<p data-aid="128200066" id="p1">Dear Fellow Missionary:</p>
<p data-aid="128200067" id="p2">We congratulate you on the great 
opportunity you have to be a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. There is no more compelling work than this, nor 
any which brings greater satisfaction.</p>
<p data-aid="128200068" id="p3"><cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> is 
intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature 
missionary and a more persuasive teacher. We urge you to use it daily in
 your personal and companion preparation, and in your district council 
and zone conferences. Study the referenced scriptures and learn the 
doctrine and principles.</p>
<p data-aid="128200069" id="p4">We invite you to rise to a new sense of 
commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work. Every 
missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the 
immortality and eternal life of man” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#p39">Moses 1:39</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128200070" id="p5">The Lord will reward and richly bless 
you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him. More happiness awaits you 
than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children.</p>
