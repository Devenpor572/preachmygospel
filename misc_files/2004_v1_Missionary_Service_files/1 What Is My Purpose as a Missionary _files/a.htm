<h2 data-aid="128204922" id="title2">Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128204923" id="p1">You are surrounded by people. You pass 
them on the street, visit them in their homes, and travel among them. 
They are all children of God, your brothers and sisters. God loves them 
just as He loves you. Many of these people are searching for purpose in 
life. They are concerned for their future and their families. They need 
the sense of belonging that comes from the knowledge that they are 
children of God, members of His eternal family. They want to feel secure
 in a world of changing values. They want “peace in this world, and 
eternal life in the world to come” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23?lang=eng#p23">Doctrine and Covenants 59:23</a>), but they are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.12?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 123:12</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128204924" id="p2">The gospel of Jesus Christ as restored 
by the Savior through the Prophet Joseph Smith will bless them and their
 families, meet their spiritual needs, and help them fulfill their <span class="page-break" data-page="2"></span>deepest
 desires. Although they may not know why, they need relief from feelings
 of loneliness and guilt that come from sin. They need to experience the
 joy of redemption by receiving forgiveness of their sins and enjoying 
the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p data-aid="128204925" id="p3">As an authorized representative of Jesus
 Christ, you can teach people with power and authority that “redemption 
cometh in and through the Holy Messiah,” and that no one “can dwell in 
the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace
 of the Holy Messiah” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.6,8?lang=eng#p6">2&nbsp;Nephi 2:6, 8</a>).
 As people come to accept the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and 
receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation by priesthood 
authority, they can be assured that they “are not cast off forever” 
(Book of Mormon, title page).</p>
<p data-aid="128204926" id="p4">As your understanding of the Savior’s 
sacrifice, also known as the Atonement of Jesus Christ, grows, your 
desire to share the gospel will increase. You will feel, as Lehi did, 
the “great … importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants 
of the earth” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.8?lang=eng#p8">2&nbsp;Nephi 2:8</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128204927" id="p5">You are called to represent Jesus Christ
 in helping people become clean from their sins and find greater 
happiness and joy. You do this by inviting them to come unto Jesus 
Christ and become converted to His restored gospel. President 
Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks taught: “We have also said much about the inspired 
summary of our work: ‘teach repentance and baptize converts.’ But 
converts to what? To Jesus Christ our Savior and our Redeemer, to His 
doctrine, to His restored gospel, to His authority, to His name. 
Conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ and His gospel should precede 
conversion to and membership in His Church. … Seek conversion to Jesus 
Christ and His gospel” (“Closing Remarks” [address given at the seminar 
for new mission presidents, June 28, 2017], 6, Church History Library, 
Salt Lake City).</p>
<p data-aid="128204928" id="p6">To come to the Savior, people must have 
faith in Him unto repentance—making the necessary changes to bring their
 life into agreement with His teachings. You can help people develop 
such faith by teaching them the restored gospel by the Spirit and 
inviting them to commit to live according to its teachings. Keeping this
 commitment prepares them for the covenant of baptism and confirmation 
and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost. They are to put off the 
“natural man” and become a Saint “through the atonement of Christ the 
Lord” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p19">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128204935" id="p7">The message of the Restoration of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ blesses individuals and families. Because of the 
Restoration we understand God’s purpose for His children: “The divine 
plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond 
the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples 
make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and 
for families to be united eternally” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&amp;para=p3#p3">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> May 2017, 145).</p>

<p data-aid="128204939" id="p8">On earth, family associations can be the
 source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on 
many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. 
The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is that all 
individuals are part of God’s family and that families can be united now
 and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can 
experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this 
life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve 
misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord
 can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power 
of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “Happiness in family life is most 
likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained
 on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love,
 compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&amp;para=p7#p7">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>,” 145).</p>

<h2 data-aid="128204941" id="title4">Teaching by the Spirit</h2>

<p data-aid="128204942" id="p10">Because the gospel of Jesus Christ is the “power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/1.16?lang=eng#p16">Romans 1:16</a>),

<h2 data-aid="128204956" id="title5">The Power and Authority of Your Calling</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128204957" id="p24">Missionaries are to go “in the power of
 the ordination wherewith [they have] been ordained, proclaiming glad 
tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/79.1?lang=eng#p1">Doctrine and Covenants 79:1</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="137163671" id="p127">As a missionary, you have authority to
 preach the gospel. President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks has taught: “Whoever 
functions in an office or calling received from one who holds priesthood
 keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned 
duties” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2014/05/priesthood-session/the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng&amp;para=p15#p15">The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite>
 May 2014, 51). As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority,
 you will receive spiritual power, which is evidence of the reality of 
your call. Do not be afraid or shy about fulfilling this commission. 
Just as the sons of Mosiah, you are to teach with the power and 
authority of God (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2-3?lang=eng#p2">Alma 17:2–3</a>). If you hold the priesthood, you also have the authority to administer the ordinances thereof.</p>
<p data-aid="128204958" id="p25">When you were set apart by priesthood 
authority, you received the right and privilege to represent the Lord. 
You received a ministerial certificate that verifies that authority to 
the world. President Spencer&nbsp;W. Kimball said: “The setting apart 
may be taken literally; it is a setting apart from sin, apart from the 
carnal; apart from everything which is crude, low, vicious, cheap, or 
vulgar; <em>set apart</em> from the world to a higher plane of thought and activity. The blessing is conditional upon faithful performance” (<cite>The Teachings of Spencer&nbsp;W. Kimball,</cite> ed. Edward&nbsp;L. Kimball [1982], 478).</p>
<p data-aid="128204959" id="p26">Along with your authority comes a 
responsibility to live worthy of your calling. As the Lord’s 
representative, you are to be “an example of the believers” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12?lang=eng#p12">1&nbsp;Timothy 4:12</a>).
 Strive to live according to God’s commandments and keep the covenants 
you made in the temple; know the scriptures; be courteous, on time, and 
dependable; follow missionary standards of conduct, dress, and grooming;
 and love the people with whom you serve and work. Honor Christ’s name

</header>
<p data-aid="128204224" id="p36">The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both
 your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and
 the “why” of missionary work.</p>
<p data-aid="137163672" id="p128">The Book of Mormon teaches plainly the
 gospel of Jesus Christ. According to the Book of Mormon the gospel of 
Jesus Christ includes (1)&nbsp;faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; 
(2)&nbsp;repentance through the Atonement of Christ; (3)&nbsp;baptism by
 immersion in Christ’s name; (4)&nbsp;the gift of the Holy Ghost; and 
(5)&nbsp;enduring to the end (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng">2&nbsp;Nephi 31</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng">3&nbsp;Nephi 11</a>; and <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng">3&nbsp;Nephi 27</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="137163673" id="p129"><span class="page-break" data-page="6"></span>It
 also teaches us what we need to believe about Christ if we are to have 
faith in Him. For example, when He presented His gospel to the people in
 the New World, the Savior said: “I came into the world to do the will 
of my Father, because my Father sent me. And my Father sent me that I 
might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up 
upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been 
lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand
 before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether
 they be evil” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.13-14?lang=eng#p13">3&nbsp;Nephi 27:13–14</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="137163674" id="p130">The Savior added, “Verily, verily, I 
say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do 
in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also 
do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.21?lang=eng#p21">3&nbsp;Nephi 27:21</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="137163675" id="p131">Additionally, the Book of Mormon 
provides insights to the kind of things we must do if we are to endure 
to the end, including the endowment and sealing ordinances of the 
temple, praying, fasting, studying the scriptures, following the example
 of the Savior, and obtaining Christlike attributes. In this context, 
the Book of Mormon teaches that we can become “saints through the 
atonement of Christ the Lord” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p19">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</p>
<aside class="quote" id="aside2">
<p data-aid="128204226" id="aside2_p1">“Preach the first principles of 
the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new 
ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You 
can enlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be
 able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.”</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p data-aid="128204231" id="p37">A purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ
 is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive His mercy at the
 day of judgment. Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important,
 the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by 
helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ 
and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and 
enduring to the end.</p>
<p data-aid="128204233" id="p38">Individuals and families begin to 
follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins. 
That faith is developed as they follow the Savior’s example by humbling 
themselves, seeking God’s will, and obeying God’s commandments (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.6-7?lang=eng#p6">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:6–7</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.13-14?lang=eng#p13">3&nbsp;Nephi 27:13–14</a>).
 They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the 
gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform 
these ordinances. They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they 
continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, 
repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made. These are not just
 steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated 
throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding 
pattern of living. In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring
 peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to 
live in His presence.</p>
<p data-aid="128204235" id="p39">Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong
 commitment. Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and 
committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can 
experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the 
Savior and His gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="128204236" id="p40">The doctrine of Christ can change how 
people believe and how they live; it also directs how you work and 
focuses your efforts. Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto 
repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and 
by inviting them to live by His teachings.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128204247" id="title7">The Message of the Restoration: The Foundation of Faith</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128204248" id="p41">No matter where you serve or whom you 
teach, center your teaching on the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. “The Lord will bless you as you teach the message of the 
Restoration to a world that desperately needs the gospel of Jesus 
Christ” (“Statement on Missionary Work,” First Presidency letter, Dec. 
11, 2002). As you study the doctrine in the missionary lessons, you will
 come to see that we have one message: Through a modern prophet, God has
 restored knowledge about the plan of salvation, which is centered on 
the Atonement of Jesus Christ and is fulfilled by living the principles 
and ordinances of the gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="128204250" id="p42">Make sure that everyone you teach clearly understands the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128204252" id="p43">God is our literal Father in Heaven. He
 loves us. Every person on earth is a child of God and a member of God’s
 family. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior and Redeemer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128204254" id="p44">Our loving Father in Heaven reached out
 to His children throughout biblical history by revealing His gospel to 
prophets. Sadly, many people rejected that gospel; even some of those 
who accepted it changed the doctrine and ordinances and fell into 
unbelief and apostasy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128204255" id="p45">Our Father in Heaven sent His Beloved 
Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. The Savior performed miracles and taught 
His gospel. He accomplished the Atonement and was resurrected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128204257" id="p46">Beginning with the First Vision, God 
has again reached out in love to His children. He restored the gospel of
 Jesus Christ and His priesthood authority and organized His Church on 
the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="137163676" id="p132">Because of the Savior’s Resurrection, 
all people will be resurrected and saved, or gain salvation, from 
physical death. This is an unconditional gift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="137163677" id="p133">People may also be saved, or gain 
salvation, from individual spiritual death through the Atonement of 
Jesus Christ, by their faith in Him, by living in obedience to the laws 
and ordinances of His gospel, and by serving Him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="137163678" id="p134">In addition to gaining salvation, we 
can also qualify for exaltation by being true to covenants made with God
 in the holy temple (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.14-20?lang=eng#p14">2&nbsp;Nephi 31:14–20</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="137163679" id="p135">The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence of the restored gospel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128204259" id="p47">As you help those you are teaching see 
the pattern of apostasy and restoration, they will be prepared to 
understand the great need for the latter-day Restoration. They will see 
the need to accept the restored gospel, receive the ordinances of 
salvation by the authority of the restored priesthood, and follow the 
way to eternal life. Help people recognize that the Church is not just 
another religion, nor is it an American church. Rather, it is a 
restoration of the “fulness of [the] gospel” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.23?lang=eng#p23">Doctrine and Covenants 1:23</a>), the same as was revealed and taught from the beginning.</p>
<p data-aid="128204261" id="p48">The Book of Mormon: Another Testament 
of Jesus Christ is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. It is <span class="page-break" data-page="8"></span>the
 keystone of our religion, the most powerful resource for teaching this 
message. Some important truths restored through Joseph Smith include the
 knowledge that God is our Father and that we are His spirit children, 
that we lived with Him before birth, and that families can be exalted 
and live together forever in God’s presence through Christ’s Atonement 
by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="128204262" id="p49">The Book of Mormon is evidence of the 
love of God for His children. It bears witness of Jesus Christ and His 
divine calling as Savior of the world. It shows that God speaks to His 
children. As you teach and testify, invite people to read the Book of 
Mormon and pray about its message. Each person you teach must decide 
whether to accept the Book of Mormon as revelation from God.</p>
<p data-aid="128204264" id="p50">Trust the remarkable promise in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng#p3">Moroni 10:3–5</a>.
 Do all you can to persuade people to read the book, to help them 
understand it, and to motivate them to ask God sincerely whether it is 
true. The witness of the Holy Ghost becomes the cornerstone of their 
faith that Christ has restored His Church. Help those you teach to 
receive that spiritual confirmation.</p>

<p data-aid="128204283" id="p51">Help people qualify for baptism and 
confirmation by teaching them true doctrine and inviting them to repent 
and change their lives through making and keeping commitments that build
 their faith in Jesus Christ. These commitments prepare people to make 
and keep sacred covenants.</p>
<p data-aid="128204285" id="p52">Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland taught: 
“The first thing you will do when [someone] tells you he or she had not 
read and prayed about the Book of Mormon is be devastated! … Much of the
 time we are just too casual about all of this. This is eternal life. 
This is the salvation of the children of God. Eternity hangs in the 
balance. … It is the most important path [a person] will ever walk. But 
if he or she doesn’t know that, at least you do! … So take control of 
this situation. Teach with power and authority, and then be devastated 
if the first steps toward commandment-keeping and covenant-keeping have

 satellite broadcast, Apr. 1997).</p>
<p data-aid="128204287" id="p53">As you teach people to understand the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you “declare repentance” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15.6?lang=eng#p6">Doctrine and Covenants 15:6</a>).
 Repentance involves a change of heart and a desire to forsake sin and 
serve God. It involves humbly yielding to the Spirit and submitting to 
God’s will. It requires that people increase their commitment to live in
 agreement with God’s will. Repentance requires a sincere and lasting 
change of thoughts, desires, habits, and actions. It is a positive 
experience that brings joy and peace. Be bold and loving in helping 
people understand what they must do to repent. By inviting people to 
make commitments, you can effectively raise a voice of both warning and 
hope.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128204307" id="p54">Baptizing and confirming the people you
 teach is central to your purpose. Baptism is for the remission of sins,
 and the gift of the Holy Ghost brings a host of blessings to those who 
live worthy of it. Through these ordinances people enter the gate and 
continue on the path to eternal life and exaltation. President 
Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks said: “We do not preach and teach in order to ‘bring
 people into the Church’ or to increase the membership of the Church. We
 do not preach and teach just to persuade people to live better lives. …
 We invite all to come unto Christ by repentance and baptism and 
confirmation in order to open the doors of the celestial kingdom to the 
sons and daughters of God. No one else can do this” (“The Purpose of 
Missionary Work,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr. 1995).</p>
<p data-aid="128204309" id="p55">As you teach the restored gospel of 
Jesus Christ, help people understand the sacred nature and need for both
 baptism by water and by the Spirit and confirmation as members of the 
Church. Help them realize that receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is a
 great blessing in this life and a key to their salvation. The Holy 
Ghost will “teach [them] all things” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14.26?lang=eng#p26">John 14:26</a>).
 President Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer taught: “When you are teaching [people] 
and preparing them for baptism by water, you must also think of the gift
 of the Holy Ghost—baptism by fire. Think of it as one sentence. First 
comes the baptism of water and then the baptism of fire” (“The Gift of 
the Holy Ghost: What Every Missionary Should Know—and Every Member As 
Well” [address given at the seminar for new mission presidents, June 
2003]). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a
 baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the 
baptism of the Holy Ghost” (<cite>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</cite> [2007], <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-7?lang=eng&amp;para=p21#p21">95</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128204312" id="p56">Help those you teach understand that to
 qualify for baptism, confirmation, and receiving the Holy Ghost, they 
must meet the conditions given in <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 20:37</a>.</p>

the bishop or branch president in a sacrament meeting soon after the 
baptism. While the two ordinances are separated by a brief time, 
confirmation complements and completes baptism.</p>

<h2 data-aid="137376589" id="title33">Go About Doing Good</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="137376590" id="p140">During His mortal ministry, the Savior “took upon him the form of a servant” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philip/2.7?lang=eng#p7">Philippians 2:7</a>). He went about “doing good” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/10.38?lang=eng#p38">Acts 10:38</a>) and “preaching the gospel” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4.23?lang=eng#p23">Matthew 4:23</a>). As you follow this example, you will find those whom you can serve and who will receive you.</p>
<p data-aid="137376591" id="p141">Through service, you fulfill the two great commandments of loving God and your neighbor (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22.36-40?lang=eng#p36">Matthew 22:36–40</a>).
 Through service, you and those who are prepared for the restored gospel
 may also come together in a powerful, inspiring way. Your good works 
will help some people recognize you as a servant of God and may lead to 
opportunities to teach the restored gospel. However, Christlike service 
should be offered as a sincere expression of love for those around you, 
without the expectation of people listening to a gospel message or 
accepting a teaching visit. </p>
<p data-aid="137376592" id="p142"><span class="page-break" data-page="11"></span>Many
 missionaries’ experience with service before their missions involved 
planned “service projects,” such as helping someone move, cleaning a 
local meetinghouse, or helping someone with yardwork. As a missionary, 
you will offer such planned service each week (see the <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/missionary-handbook/missionary-conduct?lang=eng&amp;para=title37#title37"><cite>Missionary Handbook</cite></a>
 for additional information). Under the direction of your mission 
president, you may find opportunities to serve in the community through 
JustServe (where it is approved), and the Church’s humanitarian and 
disaster response efforts.</p>
<p data-aid="137376593" id="p143">The type of service described in this 
section focuses on unplanned opportunities. This type of service 
involves listening to the Spirit to recognize opportunities for small 
acts of kindness that you can offer to God’s children. Pray and be aware
 of opportunities throughout each day to do good.</p>
<aside class="quote" id="aside3">
<p data-aid="137376594" id="aside3_p1"><span class="page-break" data-page="10"></span>“Do

<p data-aid="128205053" id="p60">Your success as a missionary is

who enjoy the presence of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p data-aid="128205054" id="p61">Avoid comparing yourself to other 
missionaries and measuring the outward results of your efforts against 
theirs. Remember that people have agency to choose whether to accept 
your message. Your responsibility is to teach clearly and powerfully so 
they can make an informed choice. Some may not accept your message even 
when they have received a spiritual witness that it is true. You will be
 saddened because you love them and desire their salvation. You should 
not, however, become discouraged; discouragement will weaken your faith.
 If you lower your expectations, your effectiveness will decrease, your 
desire will weaken, and you will have greater difficulty following the
