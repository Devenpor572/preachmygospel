</header>
<p data-aid="128203974" id="p2">This lesson works much like <a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-4-the-commandments?lang=eng">lesson&nbsp;4</a>.
 The approach you take should be determined by the needs, interests, and
 situations of the people you are teaching and direction from the 
Spirit. Constantly think and pray about how to help others live the 
gospel. Be mindful of the questions and level of understanding of those 
you teach. Ideas include:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="128203975" id="p3">Teaching one or more of the laws and ordinances from this lesson while reviewing “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-1-the-message-of-the-restoration-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng">The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ</a>,” “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-2-the-plan-of-salvation?lang=eng">The Plan of Salvation</a>,” and “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-3-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng">The Gospel of Jesus Christ</a>”
 lessons. For example, while teaching the message of the Restoration you
 may want to teach about priesthood and missionary work; while teaching 
the plan of salvation you may teach about eternal marriage, temples and 
family history service, and teaching and learning in the Church. While 
teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ you may want to teach about the 
strait and narrow way and serving in the Church.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203976" id="p4">Teaching two or three of the laws and ordinances as a single lesson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="128203977" id="p5">Teaching a single law or ordinance as a lesson.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="128203978" id="p6">Work with members to help people you are
 teaching accept and begin living these laws and ordinances. Help people
 recognize that by keeping God’s laws, they will retain a remission of 
their sins and stay on the pathway to exaltation. They will experience 
greater peace and joy. They will find answers to life’s questions and 
security in the knowledge that they belong to the true Church of Jesus 
Christ. The laws and ordinances serve as directions for living joyfully,
 with faith in Jesus Christ and a firm hope of receiving exaltation with
 our Father in Heaven.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128203984" id="title4"><span class="page-break" data-page="87"></span>Priesthood and Organizations</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128203985" id="p11">Priesthood is the power and authority 
given to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children. 
Priesthood power blesses all of us. Through the priesthood, women and 
men receive the ordinances of salvation, as well as the blessings of 
healing, comfort, and counsel.</p>
<p data-aid="128203986" id="p12">The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is led by Jesus Christ through apostles and prophets. 
These are righteous men who are called of God and given the priesthood. 
Anciently Christ ordained His Apostles and gave them the priesthood. 
That authority was lost when the people rejected the gospel and killed 
Christ and the Apostles.</p>
<p data-aid="128203987" id="p13">Priesthood authority was restored in 
1829 when John the Baptist appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery. He laid his hands on their heads and conferred on them 
the Aaronic Priesthood (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/13?lang=eng">Doctrine and Covenants 13</a>).
 A short time later Peter, James, and John of the original Twelve 
Apostles laid their hands on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and 
conferred upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood, which Peter, James, and 
John had received from Jesus Christ (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.12-13?lang=eng#p12">Doctrine and Covenants 27:12–13</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128203988" id="p14">A man can receive priesthood authority 
only by proper ordination by the laying on of hands by one who has the 
authority. A man who receives the priesthood is given a marvelous 
opportunity. He enters a covenant to fulfill sacred duties, serve 
others, and help build up the Church. He must have a desire to serve God
 and must be ordained to this power (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.3?lang=eng#p3">Doctrine and Covenants 4:3</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.57?lang=eng#p57">63:57</a>).
 It is also necessary for priesthood holders to perform sacred 
ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation. When priesthood authority 
is used worthily, the power of God is manifest. Priesthood power can be 
used only in righteousness, love, and patience.</p>
<p data-aid="137171685" id="p32">How does this apply to women? President
 Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks taught that women who are set apart as 
missionaries, officers, or teachers in the Church are “given priesthood 
authority to perform a priesthood function” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2014/04/the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng&amp;para=p11-16#p11">The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> May 2014, 51).</p>
<p data-aid="128203989" id="p15">All priesthood comes from God. There 
are two priesthoods in the Church: the Aaronic Priesthood and the 
Melchizedek Priesthood. The Aaronic Priesthood administers ordinances 
such as baptism and the sacrament. Worthy males of the appropriate age 
receive the Aaronic Priesthood soon after baptism and confirmation.</p>
<p data-aid="128203990" id="p16">Worthy adult males will eventually 
receive the Melchizedek, or higher, Priesthood. Members of the Church 
receive many spiritual and temporal blessings through the power of this 
priesthood. Worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holders can confer the gift of
 the Holy Ghost, ordain others to the priesthood as assigned, anoint the
 sick with consecrated oil, and give blessings of healing and comfort. 
Worthy husbands and fathers who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood can give
 their spouses, children, and other family members special blessings. 
Ministering brothers care for individuals and families in the households
 of Church members. Ministering sisters care for other women in the 
Church. Bishops and stake presidents are judges in the Church. They have
 the authority to help Saints who have sinned to repent and enjoy the 
full blessings of Church membership. They interview people to ensure 
their worthiness to enter the temple.</p>
<p data-aid="137171686" id="p33">In an address to the Relief Society, 
President Joseph Fielding Smith taught: “While the sisters have not been
 given the Priesthood, it has not been conferred upon them, that does 
not mean that the Lord has not given unto them authority. … A [man] may 
have authority given to him, or a sister to her, to do certain things in
 the Church that are binding and absolutely necessary for our salvation,
 such as the work that our sisters do in the House <span class="page-break" data-page="88"></span>of
 the Lord. They have authority given unto them to do some great and 
wonderful things, sacred unto the Lord, and binding just as thoroughly 
as are the blessings that are given by the men who hold the Priesthood” 
(Joseph Fielding Smith, “Relief Society—an Aid to the Priesthood,” <cite>Relief Society Magazine,</cite> Jan. 1959, 4).</p>
<p data-aid="128203991" id="p17">Church organizations are organized by 
priesthood authority to assist in strengthening members. Both men and 
women are a great resource in missionary work as they assist in finding,
 teaching, and fellowshipping new converts. The Relief Society, which 
includes women ages 18 and over, reaches out in service to families, 
individuals, and the community. Young women ages 11 to 18 are members of
 the Young Women program. Boys of similar ages participate in the Young 
Men program. All children ages 3 to 11 are part of the Primary 
organization. All members age 11 and older are enrolled in Sunday School
 classes.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128204007" id="p18">Members who share the gospel experience
 joy and have the Spirit of the Lord more abundantly. As we share the 
gospel, we appreciate how precious and meaningful it is to us, and we 
feel a greater love for God and others. The Lord commanded His followers
 to preach the gospel in all the world, giving every person the 
opportunity to accept or reject it. When people are baptized, they make a
 covenant to always stand as witnesses of God. They are commanded to 
share the gospel with those who have not yet received it. As they live 
the gospel faithfully, they will set an example, showing their family 
members and friends the great blessings that come from living the 
gospel. They should also take advantage of opportunities to answer 
questions, share printed materials or digital media, and invite others 
to learn more about the message of the restored gospel. Members should 
pray for those who are not members of the Church. They should pray for 
missionary opportunities—to serve those who are not of our faith and 
share what they believe. The Lord promises to help members know what to 
say and do as they share the gospel.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128204022" id="title6">Eternal Marriage</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128204023" id="p19">The basic unit of the Church is the 
family. Within the family, people experience many of life’s greatest 
joys and sorrows. Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God 
and is central to God’s eternal plan for the salvation of His children. 
The means by which mortal life is created is divinely appointed and is 
safeguarded by marriage. The divine plan of happiness enables family 
relationships to endure beyond the grave. Marriage, however, can be 
eternal only when authorized priesthood holders perform the sealing 
ordinance in sacred temples and when husbands and wives who have been 
sealed together keep the covenants they have made. Husbands and wives 
are to love each other. As they keep the commandments and live gospel 
principles, they are to honor their marital vows with complete fidelity 
(see “<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&amp;para=p3-7#p3">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>,” <cite>Ensign</cite> or <cite>Liahona,</cite> May 2017, 145; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.22?lang=eng#p22">Doctrine and Covenants 42:22</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="128204024" id="p20">Happiness in family life is most likely
 to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ and when
 parents make their family their highest priority. “By divine design, 
fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and
 are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for 
their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of 
their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers 
are obligated to help one another as equal partners” (“<a class="cross-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&amp;para=p7#p7">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>,” 145). Together, parents are to teach their children the gospel of Jesus Christ and help them live it.</p>
<p data-aid="128204025" id="p21">Satan is making a concentrated attack 
on families. Years ago Church leaders set aside one evening a week as a 
time for home evening. Parents should use this time to teach their 
children the gospel, strengthen their relationships with them, and have 
fun together. Other ways of strengthening the family include daily 
family prayer and scripture study, worshipping at church as a family, 
doing family history, and serving others. Heaven is a continuation of 
the ideal family. Through priesthood ordinances and righteous living, we
 can live as families in God’s presence eternally.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128204053" id="title7">Temples and Family History</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128204055" id="p22">God has commanded His people to build 
temples. In the temple we make sacred covenants and are endowed with, or
 are given, a gift of power and knowledge from on high. This power helps
 us in our daily lives and enables us to build God’s kingdom. In the 
temple we can also be married for time and eternity, thus making it 
possible for families to be together forever in God’s presence. After at
 least one year of membership, worthy adults may be eligible to receive 
from their bishop a recommend to receive their own endowment. After 
receiving their endowments, married couples may be sealed or married for
 eternity.</p>
<p data-aid="128204056" id="p23">The Savior loves all people and desires
 their salvation. Yet millions of people have died without having any 
opportunity to hear the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ 
or receive saving ordinances. Through His loving grace and mercy the 
Lord makes salvation possible for everyone who did not have the 
opportunity to receive, understand, and obey the gospel during their 
mortal lives. The gospel is preached to these deceased people in the 
spirit world. Members of the Church on earth perform the saving 
ordinances in behalf of their deceased ancestors and others. Deceased 
persons living in the spirit world have the opportunity to accept or 
reject the gospel and the ordinances performed in their behalf.</p>
<p data-aid="128204057" id="p24">For this reason, Church members search 
for information about their ancestors. They can then add the information
 they find to the Church’s database at FamilySearch.org. A person can do
 so either on their own or with the help of a temple and family history 
consultant. The Church’s database then allows Church members to share or
 print out and take to the temple the names of deceased relatives who 
need to have saving ordinances performed on their behalf in sacred 
temples. This is an important aspect of doing family history. Worthy 
members of the appropriate age, including new members, are eligible to 
receive from their bishop a limited-use recommend to participate in 
performing baptisms and confirmations for these deceased ancestors.</p>

leader, introduce those you are teaching and new converts to another 
ward member who is familiar with temple and family history service (such
 as a temple and family history consultant). They can help those people 
identify their deceased relatives who are in need of temple ordinances. 
Where possible, go with new members to the temple. Participate with them
 in performing temple ordinances.</p>

<h2 data-aid="128204075" id="title8">Service</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="128204076" id="p25">One of the great blessings of 
membership in the Church is the opportunity to serve. When we give 
loving service to others, we are serving God. When we are baptized, we 
covenant to give such service (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-10?lang=eng#p8">Mosiah 18:8–10</a>).
 We are to become aware of others’ physical and spiritual needs. We then
 give of our time, talents, and means to help meet those needs. We 
follow the example of the Savior, who came to serve others. We are to do
 what Jesus did and become like Him.</p>
<p data-aid="128204077" id="p26">Soon after baptism new members receive 
from priesthood leaders the blessing of a responsibility to help in the 
Church. This is referred to as a calling. All of the work in the Church 
is voluntary. No one is paid for such service. When we accept callings, 
we are sustained publicly in a Church meeting so that other members can 
acknowledge our calling and provide support. We are also set apart by a 
priesthood leader and given special blessings to help us fulfill our 
callings. The Church needs the talents and abilities of every member to 
fill a wide variety of callings. All callings are important and help 
build God’s kingdom. We are to accept such callings and work diligently 
to learn and fulfill our duties. As we do so, we grow in faith, develop 
new talents and a greater ability to serve, and receive numerous other 
blessings.</p>
<p data-aid="128204078" id="p27">Sisters and priesthood holders may be 
given assignments to minister to others. As members minister, they 
determine through communication and inspiration the frequency and type 
of contact they have with those to whom they give care. Ministering 
brothers care for individuals and families in households. Ministering 
sisters represent the Relief Society by caring for each adult sister as 
assigned.</p>
<p data-aid="137171687" id="p34">Some opportunities to care for those in
 need come through Church callings. Other opportunities are present in 
members’ homes, neighborhoods, and communities, such as those 
coordinated by JustServe (where it is approved). Members can also help 
the poor <span class="page-break" data-page="92"></span>and needy of all
 faiths throughout the world by supporting the Church’s humanitarian 
efforts, by participating in disaster response, and by giving individual
 efforts to serve others in need.</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="128204125" id="p29">As we continue to live the gospel, we 
grow closer to our Heavenly Father. We enjoy and appreciate more the 
Atonement of the Savior. Our families are drawn closer together. We 
experience greater feelings of the love, joy, and peace that come from 
following the Savior and applying His Atonement. Our hearts are changed,
 and we find security in living the restored gospel.</p>
<p data-aid="128204127" id="p30"><span class="page-break" data-page="93"></span>As
 we continue to exercise faith in Christ, repent, and renew our 
covenants, we enjoy continued guidance from the Holy Ghost. If we endure
 to the end of our lives in being true to our covenants, we will receive
 exaltation.</p>
<p data-aid="137171688" id="p35">President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson 
taught: “Keep on the covenant path. … Your commitment to follow the 
Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants 
will open the door to every spiritual privilege and blessing available 
to men, women, and children everywhere. … The end for which each of us 
strives is to be endowed with a power in a house of the Lord, sealed as 
families—faithful to the covenants made in a temple that qualify us for 
the greatest gift of God, that of eternal life” (live telecast from the 
annex of the Salt Lake Temple, Jan. 16, 2018).</p>
<p data-aid="128204129" id="p31">A few members do not endure or remain 
fully active. However, enduring to the end is a personal responsibility.
 We “work out [our] own salvation” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="https://site.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philip/2.12?lang=eng#p12">Philippians 2:12</a>), and we serve and love those whose faith has grown weak through inactivity.</p>
