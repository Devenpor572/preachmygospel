Preach My Gospel
Use Preach My Gospel to meet your needs as a missionary as you become a more deeply committed disciple of Jesus Christ.
You can spend an entire study session on just a few paragraphs—or an entire chapter.
You can study chapters in order or plan another sequence that better meets your needs.
This flexibility allows you to study what you need when you need it and as directed by your mission president.
All of the chapters in Preach My Gospel will help prepare you to fulfill your purpose as a missionary.
However, as you begin to study chapter 3 , you may sense a difference in approach.
Most of the chapters are addressed to you.
Chapter 3 is addressed to a more general audience.
You learn the doctrine in chapter 3 (a) to strengthen your own gospel knowledge and testimony and (b) to teach others and prepare them to make and keep commitments and covenants.
The doctrine in some of the other chapters may also help you teach people.
For example, chapter 4, “ How Do I Recognize and Understand the Spirit?
” may help you teach people about how to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost.
Chapter 5, “ What Is the Role of the Book of Mormon?
” may help you resolve someone’s concerns about reading the Book of Mormon.
Ideas from chapter 2, “ How Do I Study Effectively and Prepare to Teach?
” may help new converts gain more from their study of the Book of Mormon.
Preach My Gospel focuses on the essentials of missionary work.
It does not answer every question or situation you will encounter.
You will be most effective as you follow the Spirit, search the scriptures, keep the commandments, and apply what you learn.
Study the chapters throughout your mission.
Apply what you learn.
Evaluate your work.
Missionaries who strive to prepare themselves daily and seek to improve regularly will receive direction from the Holy Ghost and see blessings in their lives.
