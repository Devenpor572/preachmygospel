Our Covenant to Serve God and Others
Service
When we are baptized, we covenant to serve God and to serve others.
Serving others is one of the primary ways we serve God (see Mosiah 2:17 ).
The prophet Alma taught those who desired to be baptized that they should be “willing to bear one another’s burdens, … mourn with those that mourn … , and comfort those that stand in need of comfort” ( Mosiah 18:8–9 ).
Soon after baptism, new members typically receive a calling to serve in the Church.
These callings are voluntary and unpaid.
As we accept them and serve diligently, we grow in faith, develop talents, and bless others.
Another part of our service in the Church is being a “ministering brother” or a “ministering sister.” In this responsibility, we serve assigned individuals and families.
As disciples of Jesus Christ, we look for opportunities to serve each day.
Like Him, we go “about doing good” ( Acts 10:38 ).
We serve our neighbors and others in our community.
We can participate in service opportunities through JustServe where it is available.
We can support the Church’s humanitarian efforts and participate in disaster response.

Sharing the Gospel
As part of our baptismal covenant, we promise to “stand as witnesses of God” ( Mosiah 18:9 ).
One way we stand as witnesses is by sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Helping others receive the gospel is one of the most joyful kinds of service we can give (see Doctrine and Covenants 18:15–16 ).
It is a powerful expression of our love.
When we experience the blessings of living the gospel, we naturally want to share those blessings.
Family members, friends, and acquaintances often become interested as we set a faithful example and they see how the gospel blesses our lives.
We can share the gospel in normal and natural ways (see General Handbook , chapter 23 ).
We invite others to participate with us in service, community, recreational, and Church activities.
We can invite them to a Church meeting or a baptismal service.
We can invite them to watch an online video that explains the gospel of Jesus Christ, to read the Book of Mormon, or to visit a temple open house.
There are hundreds of invitations we can extend.
Often, inviting simply means including our family, friends, and neighbors in what we are already doing.
If we ask, God will help us recognize opportunities to share the gospel and tell others about how it blesses our lives.
For more information about applying the principles of loving, sharing, and inviting, see “ Unite with Members ” in chapter 9.

Fasting and Fast Offerings
God established the law of the fast as a way for us to develop spiritual strength and to help those in need.
Fasting means going without food and drink for a period of time.
The Church usually sets aside the first Sunday of every month as a day of fasting.
A fast day typically includes going without food and drink for a 24-hour period if we are physically able.
Other important parts of fast Sunday include prayer and bearing testimony.
We are also encouraged to fast at other times when we feel the need.
Building Spiritual Strength
Fasting can help us become humble, draw closer to God, and feel spiritually renewed.
Before beginning His ministry, Jesus Christ fasted (see Matthew 4:1–2 ).
The scriptures record many accounts of prophets and others fasting so they might increase their spiritual strength and seek special blessings for themselves or others.
Fasting and prayer go together.
When we fast and pray with faith, we are more attuned to receiving personal revelation.
We are also more receptive to recognizing truth and understanding God’s will.
Helping Those in Need
When we fast, we donate money to the Church to help care for people in need.
This is called a fast offering.
We are invited to give an offering that is at least equal to the value of the meals not eaten.
We are encouraged to be generous and give more than the value of these meals if we can.
Giving a fast offering is one way we can serve others.
Fast offerings are used to provide food and other necessities to people in need, both locally and worldwide.
For information about how to contribute fast offerings, see “ Donating Tithes and Other Offerings ” in this lesson.
