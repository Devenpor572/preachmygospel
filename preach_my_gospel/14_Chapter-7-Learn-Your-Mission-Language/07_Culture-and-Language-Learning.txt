Culture and Language Learning
Culture and language are closely related.
Understanding the culture of the people will help explain the way language is used.
This understanding will also help you communicate the unique aspects of the message of the Restoration in a way that will be clear to people.
One of the greatest things you can do to gain people’s trust and love is to respect and embrace their culture in appropriate ways.
Many great missionaries have done this (see 1 Corinthians 9:20–23 ).
