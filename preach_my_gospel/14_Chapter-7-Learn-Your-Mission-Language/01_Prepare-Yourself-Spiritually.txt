Prepare Yourself Spiritually
The Lord declared, “Every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power” ( Doctrine and Covenants 90:11 ).

Believe that you have been called of God by a prophet.
Ask for God’s help through sincere prayer.
Work diligently by studying, practicing, and using your mission language each day.
Be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost by keeping the commandments and living the missionary standards.
