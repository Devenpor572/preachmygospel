Be Dedicated and Diligent
Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort and the gifts of the Spirit.
Do not be surprised if the task seems hard.
It takes time.
Be patient with yourself.
As you dedicate yourself to learning the language, you will acquire the skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a missionary.
You are not alone in learning your mission language.
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will help you as you seek Their help.
Seek and be open to the help of your companion, members, those you teach, other missionaries, and other people.
Listen carefully and speak the language at every opportunity.
Do not be afraid to make mistakes.
Everyone who learns a new language makes mistakes.
People will understand, and they will appreciate your efforts to learn their language.
Keep improving your language skills until the end of your mission.
As your ability to speak the language grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you say it.
You will be less worried about how to communicate and better able to respond to the needs of others.
“We would … hope that every missionary learning a new … language would master it in every way possible.
… And as you do so, your [teaching] and testifying skills will improve.
You will be better received by and more spiritually impressive to [the people you teach].
…
“Don’t be satisfied with what we call a missionary vocabulary only.
Stretch yourself in the language, and you will gain greater access to the hearts of the people” (Jeffrey R.
Holland, missionary satellite broadcast, Aug.
1998).
Continue to use your mission language after you return home.
The Lord has invested much in you, and He may have uses for your language abilities later in your life.
