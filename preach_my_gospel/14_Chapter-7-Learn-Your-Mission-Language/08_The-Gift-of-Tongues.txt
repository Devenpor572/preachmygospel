The Gift of Tongues
Gifts of the Spirit are real.
The gift of tongues and the interpretation of tongues have many manifestations.
Some of these include speaking, understanding, and interpreting languages.
Today the gift of tongues is most often manifested in Spirit-enhanced learning and studying to help missionaries learn the language in their mission.
The Holy Ghost can manifest the truth of your testimony even though a language barrier may exist between you and those you teach.
Likewise, the Holy Ghost can bring words and phrases to your remembrance and help you understand what people are saying from their hearts.
For the most part, you will not obtain these gifts without effort.
You need to actively seek them to bless others (see Doctrine and Covenants 46:8–9, 26 ).
Part of seeking the gift of tongues is to labor and do all you can to learn the language.
Be patient as you prayerfully study and practice the language.
Trust that the Spirit will help you as you make a diligent effort.
Have faith that you can have the gift of tongues help you and those you teach.
When you struggle to express yourself as clearly as you would like, remember that the Spirit is able to speak to the hearts of God’s children.
President Thomas S.
Monson taught:
“There is one language … that is common to each missionary—the language of the Spirit.
It is not learned from textbooks written by men of letters, nor is it acquired through reading and memorization.
The language of the Spirit comes to him who seeks with all his heart to know God and keep His divine commandments.
Proficiency in this language permits one to breach barriers, overcome obstacles, and touch the human heart” (“ The Spirit Giveth Life ,” Ensign , June 1997, 2).
