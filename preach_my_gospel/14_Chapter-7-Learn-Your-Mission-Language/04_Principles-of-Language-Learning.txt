Principles of Language Learning
Take Responsibility
Set goals for improving your language ability, and adjust them regularly.
Create a language study plan.
Use the language at every opportunity.
Make Your Study Meaningful
Apply what you study to real-life situations and in your daily activities.
Focus on language that will help you say what you need to say.
Seek to Communicate
Speak the language with your companion as much as possible.
Take advantage of every opportunity to learn and practice.
For example, you might ask a returning member or someone you are teaching to help you with the language.
There is no substitute for talking with native speakers of the language.
Do Not Compare
Do not compare your language skills with those of your companion or other missionaries.
Comparison leads to either pride or discouragement.
Learn New Concepts Thoroughly
Review regularly what you have studied, and practice it in new situations.
This will help you recall and apply what you are learning.
