Ministering Assignments
With approval from the mission president, local leaders may consider asking full-time missionaries to assist in ministering assignments on a limited basis.
The mission president communicates this approval to the stake president, who informs bishops.
When such approval is given, full-time missionaries are assigned primarily to work with new members, part-member families, and returning members (see Handbook 2: Administering the Church [2010], 7.4.3 ).
