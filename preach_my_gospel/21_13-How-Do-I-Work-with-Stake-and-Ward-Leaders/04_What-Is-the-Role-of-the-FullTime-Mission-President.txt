What Is the Role of the Full-Time Mission President?
The full-time mission president holds the keys for convert baptisms.
Under his direction, full-time missionaries have primary responsibility for teaching the gospel to people not of our faith.
However, the bishop oversees the personâ€™s progress and friendshipping as he or she is being taught.
The ward mission plan is carried out under the presiding authority of the bishop.
The mission president meets regularly with stake presidents to make sure that full-time missionaries cooperate with local priesthood leaders.
He coordinates missionary efforts and offers to help the stake president provide instruction in the principles and practices of missionary work.
