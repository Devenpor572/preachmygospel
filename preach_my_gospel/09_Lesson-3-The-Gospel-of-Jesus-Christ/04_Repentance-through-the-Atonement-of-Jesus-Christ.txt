Repentance through the Atonement of Jesus Christ
Repentance through the Atonement of Jesus Christ is another important principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will.
Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world.
When we repent, we feel godly sorrow and return to Him with full purpose of heart.
We stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right.
Bringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance and faith on Jesus Christ is a central purpose of our lives.
We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s grace and mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy on the condition of repentance.
To repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow.
We confess our sins to God.
We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who will support us as we truly repent.
We ask God to forgive us.
We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution.
As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes.
As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over.
If we sincerely repent, we turn away from our sins and do them no more.
We resist any desire to commit sin.
Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper.
Sincere repentance brings several results.
We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives.
Our guilt and sorrow are swept away.
We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance.
And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son.
Even after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again.
We should continually try to correct these transgressions, remembering we “can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth” us ( Philippians 4:13 ).
In addition, we should continually improve—develop Christlike qualities, grow in knowledge, and serve more effectively.
As we learn more about what the Savior wants for us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him.
Thus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve.
Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike.
We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily.
