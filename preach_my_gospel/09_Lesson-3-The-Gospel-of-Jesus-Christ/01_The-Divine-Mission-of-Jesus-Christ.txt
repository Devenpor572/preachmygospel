The Divine Mission of Jesus Christ
God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, into the world so that all of God’s children would have the possibility of experiencing joy and peace in this world and everlasting life in the world to come with their families.
Additionally, through Jesus Christ all God’s children will live again when their bodies and spirits are reunited in the Resurrection (see Doctrine and Covenants 76:40–42 ).
As the result of Adam and Eve’s transgression, death is experienced by all people.
And because all people have made mistakes and sinned, they are unable to return to live with God because “no unclean thing can dwell” in His presence ( 1 Nephi 10:21 ).
However, through the Savior’s grace and mercy we will live again as resurrected beings and can be clean from sin so that we can live in our Heavenly Father’s presence.
Becoming clean from sin is being healed spiritually (see 3 Nephi 9:13 ; 18:32 ).
Because of the Savior’s sacrifice, known as the Atonement of Christ, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16 ; Helaman 14:15–18 ; 3 Nephi 27:14–22 ; Doctrine and Covenants 137:9 ) and will be raised from the dead.
We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy.
Justice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience.
We all commit sin.
Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21 ; 3 Nephi 27:19 ; Moses 6:57 ).
The Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins.
This act is called the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
Because of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf.
Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence.
Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence.
However, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility.
He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments.
Through Jesus Christ’s Atonement and living the gospel we can enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently.
We show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by doing His will and keeping His commandments, including obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel.
Nephi refers to these principles and ordinances as “the doctrine of Christ” ( 2 Nephi 31:2 – 32:6 ).
Sin
The notion of “sin” means different things in different cultures.
In some cultures it is closely associated with the concept of committing crime.
In others it applies only if one is caught doing something wrong and thus brings shame to a family or community.
Clarify that sin is disobedience to God’s commandments and results in becoming separated from God.
God knows all that we do and think, and we displease Him when we sin.
Do not discuss your past transgressions or ask those you teach to discuss their past transgressions.
