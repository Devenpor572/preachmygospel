The Gift of the Holy Ghost
Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit.
Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of fire and of the Spirit or it is incomplete (see 2 Nephi 31:13–14 ).
Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn.
We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ.
The Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us.
Through the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, we can receive and retain a remission of sins through continued faith in Christ, repentance, and following the will of God and obedience to His commandments.
Those who receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and remain worthy can enjoy His companionship throughout their lives.
The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth.
He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right.
He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow.
He warns us of spiritual or physical danger.
The Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn.
The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts.
Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us.
This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life and exaltation.
After a person is baptized by water, one or more authorized priesthood holders lay their hands upon the person’s head and confirm the person a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
They then confer the gift of the Holy Ghost.
The priesthood authority needed to perform this ordinance, which was lost centuries ago through the death of the Savior’s Apostles, was restored through angelic administration to a modern prophet, Joseph Smith.
Only through membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can one receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the right to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion.
This authority makes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints different from any other religion in the world.
By the Lord’s own declaration, it is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” ( Doctrine and Covenants 1:30 ).
Guidance from the Holy Ghost
Explain to those whom you are teaching that Satan opposes God and entices people to commit sin.
To retain the good feelings they have had while meeting the missionaries, they should read the Book of Mormon, pray, attend church, and obey the commandments.
Explain that having the continued guidance of the Holy Ghost is one of the benefits of being baptized and confirmed.
As needed, teach the person how to pray.
See the sections “Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost” in Lesson 1 and “ Pray Often ” in Lesson 4 for guidance on how you might help someone learn how to pray.
