Faith in Jesus Christ
The gospel of Jesus Christ begins with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world.
It is to believe there is no “salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” ( Acts 4:12 ).
There are other things that we need to believe if we are to have faith in Christ (see 3 Nephi 27:13–15 ).
We recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy.
When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings.
We trust Him and what He says.
We know that He has the power to keep His promises.
We can develop faith in Christ through humility and doing His will and keeping His commandments.
Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to listen to and obey His Son.
Faith in Christ leads to action.
It leads to sincere and lasting change.
Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior with “unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save” ( 2 Nephi 31:19 ).
We want to learn His will and keep His commandments.
Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving through the power of Christ’s Atonement to keep His commandments and avoid sin.
We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments.
We show our faith by obeying Him.
We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation.
As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17 ).
We also grow in faith by hearing and reading the word of God (see Romans 10:17 ; Helaman 15:7–8 ).
As we obey God, He blesses us.
He gives us power to meet life’s challenges.
He helps us change the desires of our hearts.
Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually.
