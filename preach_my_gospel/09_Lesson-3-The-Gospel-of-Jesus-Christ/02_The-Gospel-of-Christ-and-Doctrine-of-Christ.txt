The Gospel of Christ and Doctrine of Christ
The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:12 ).
It also contains the clearest presentation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, sometimes referred to as the doctrine of Christ, found anywhere in scripture.
According to the Book of Mormon the gospel of Jesus Christ includes five key points: (1) faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) repentance through the Atonement of Christ; (3) baptism by immersion in Christ’s name; (4) the gift of the Holy Ghost; and (5) enduring to the end (see 2 Nephi 31 ; 3 Nephi 11 ; 27 ).
Additionally, the Book of Mormon teaches us what we must believe about Christ in order to have faith in Him (see 3 Nephi 27:13–15 ).
