Use Technology
There are many ways you can use technology to find people to teach.
Some examples are listed below:
Use social media to work with members to find people.
Build relationships by reaching out through email and social media.
Share uplifting scriptures, quotes, and gospel messages.
Help people use FamilySearch.org to learn more about their deceased family members.
Offer online classes to teach skills.
Make appropriate connections through shared online interest groups.
Create a post that tells about upcoming ward events.
Using technology is an important way to keep “multiple lines in the water” throughout the day.
In addition to your other finding efforts, keep multiple internet lines in the water.
Elder David A.
Bednar taught: “Technology provides a multitude of powerful channels through which we can proclaim ‘Jesus Christ, and him crucified’ and ‘preach repentance unto the people’ [ 1 Corinthians 2:2 ; Doctrine and Covenants 44:3 ].
The rising generation is especially well prepared to hear and learn about the restored gospel through these means of communication” (“They Should Proclaim These Things unto the World,” seminar for new mission presidents, June 24, 2016).
