Find When You Teach
Finding and teaching are related activities.
People you teach often have friends or relatives who are prepared to receive the restored gospel.
As the people you teach experience the blessings of the gospel, their desire to share it will increase (see 1 Nephi 8:12 ).
In all situations—such as finding, teaching, and working with members—ask, “Who do you know who would benefit from this message?”
When those you teach are preparing for their baptismal service, ask them about family and friends they would like to invite to their baptism.
Make plans to invite and encourage all to come.
The Spirit can be powerfully felt during a baptismal service.
Companion Study
Review a list of people you are teaching.
Make a list of those you have asked for referrals and those you have not asked.
Practice how you will extend a referral invitation to those in each group.
In your planner, make a note to extend this invitation in your next visits.
