Find through the Preach My Gospel App
The Preach My Gospel app is a great resource for finding people to teach.
Missionaries who consistently use the features in this app have more success finding.
To become acquainted with these features, refer to training provided within the app.
Be sensitive to spiritual promptings you may receive as you review the names of people.
The app includes information about people who were previously referred, contacted, or taught.
Some of these people might want to meet with missionaries again.
They might also know of other people who may be interested in learning about the gospel.
In your planning, use the map and filters in the app to prioritize which people to visit.
Look at their information and learn how they were found.
See if there is a record about members who helped them.
Use this information to determine how best to reach out to them again.
Use the filters feature in the app to identify all those who:
Had a previously scheduled baptismal date but were not baptized.
Attended sacrament meeting at least once but were not baptized.
Received more than three lessons.
Have not been contacted recently.
If people you contact are not interested in being taught or choose to stop receiving visits, record that information in the app.
Record how you will keep in touch with them and nurture them until they are ready to learn more.
For example, consider inviting them to sign up for an email series to receive messages about Jesus Christ or other gospel topics.
You might also connect them with a member who can answer questions and nurture their interest and friendship.
Set a reminder in the app to follow up with them.
Ask if they know anyone else who might be interested.
You can also find people to teach through the Preach My Gospel app by using filters or groups to send group messages.
This can be a great way to let people know about events like ward activities and baptismal services.
Follow up with personal invitations to these events.
