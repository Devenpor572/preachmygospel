Opportunities for Study and Learning
Effective study during your mission will help you strengthen your testimony of the gospel and become a more faithful disciple of Jesus Christ.
Studying the scriptures and Preach My Gospel will help you teach with spiritual power.
It will also help you make your teaching relevant to the needs of individuals.
Important study and learning opportunities include:
Personal study.
Companion study.
Companion exchanges.
District council meetings.
Zone conferences.
Mission leadership council (for young missionary leaders).
Most days, your missionary schedule includes time for personal and companion study.
See Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ , 2.4 , for information about your daily schedule.
What you learn in personal study will help you in companion study and the other learning opportunities listed above.
In these settings you “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” ( Doctrine and Covenants 88:77 ).
