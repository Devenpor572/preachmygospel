Use of Preach My Gospel by Church Members
Preach My Gospel is a valuable resource not just for missionaries but for all members of the Church.
For example, studying it will help members:
Learn and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ (study chapters 1 , 2 , 3 , and 10 ).
Answer questions about the gospel (study chapters 3 and 5 ).
Understand more about seeking and relying on the Holy Ghost (study chapter 4 ).
Understand the power of the Book of Mormon (study chapter 5 ).
Seek Christlike attributes (study chapter 6 ).
Fulfill their covenant responsibility to share the gospel by living the principles of love, share, and invite (study chapters 9 and 13 ).
Build unity with the full-time missionaries (study chapter 13 ).
Studying Preach My Gospel —especially chapter 3 —will be particularly helpful for both youth and seniors who are preparing for missionary service.
