How does your name tag differ from that worn by an employee of a company?
Note that the two most prominent parts are your name and the Savior’s name.
How can you ensure that you represent the Savior as one of His disciples?

Remember This
You need to be a Christlike missionary, not just do missionary things.
Learning to be like Christ is a lifelong pursuit.
You follow Christ’s example—develop His attributes—one action and decision at a time.
Changing to become Christlike requires exercising faith, repenting, keeping covenants, receiving an increased measure of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
