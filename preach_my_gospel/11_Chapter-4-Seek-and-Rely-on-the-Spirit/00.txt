Consider This
What can I do to have the power of the Holy Ghost in my life and missionary service?
What is the role of the Holy Ghost in conversion?
How can I help the people we teach feel the influence of the Holy Ghost?
How can I make my prayers more meaningful?
How can I learn to recognize the promptings of the Holy Ghost?
