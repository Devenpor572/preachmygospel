Rely on the Spirit
As the Lord’s servant, you are to do His work in His way and by His power.
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “no man can preach the Gospel without the Holy Ghost” ( Teachings: Joseph Smith , 332 ).
Trust the Spirit to guide you in every aspect of your work.
He will enlighten and inspire you.
He will help you find people to teach and will bring power to your teaching.
He will assist as you help members, returning members, and new converts strengthen their faith.
Some missionaries feel confident in themselves.
Others lack such confidence.
Humbly put your confidence and faith in Jesus Christ, not in yourself.
Rely on the Spirit rather than your own talents and abilities.
The Holy Ghost will magnify your efforts far beyond what you can do on your own.
