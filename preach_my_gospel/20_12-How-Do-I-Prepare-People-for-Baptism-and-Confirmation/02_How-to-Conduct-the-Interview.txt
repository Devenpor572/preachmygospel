How to Conduct the Interview
The person conducting the interview should use the baptismal interview questions with the guidance of the Spirit to determine whether the baptismal candidate meets the qualifications described in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 .
He should also adapt the questions to the age and maturity of the candidate.
If a candidate does not qualify according to the baptismal interview questions, the baptism and confirmation should be postponed.
The person should receive additional teaching by the full-time missionaries and fellowshipping from ward members.
The district leader or zone leader who conducts the interview should:
Hold the interview in a comfortable, private place, conducive to feeling the Spirit of the Lord.
When interviewing a child, youth, or woman, the interviewer’s companion should be nearby in the adjoining room, foyer, or hall.
If the person being interviewed desires, another adult may be invited to participate in the interview.
Missionaries should avoid all circumstances that could be misunderstood (see “ Preventing and Responding to Abuse ,” First Presidency letter, March 26, 2018).
Open with prayer.
Help the candidate feel comfortable.
Make the interview a spiritually uplifting experience.

Baptism and Confirmation: Questions and Answers
Who conducts the interview for baptism?
Normally the district leader interviews baptismal candidates taught by missionaries in his district, including candidates taught by his zone leaders.
The zone leader interviews candidates taught by the district leader.
The mission president or one of his counselors must interview people involved in serious sins.

What is the definition of a convert baptism?
Convert baptisms are baptisms of:
Persons ages nine and older who have never been baptized and confirmed as members of the Church.
Children age eight whose parents are not members of the Church or whose parents are being baptized and confirmed at the same time as the child.
Do I need permission to baptize a minor child?
The Church’s concern with respect to children is their current and future well-being and the harmony of their home environment.
For their protection, the following conditions must be met before you can baptize a minor child under legal age, as defined by local laws:
You must obtain permission from both parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and they must understand the doctrine that a baptized child will be taught and the covenants he or she will be expected to make.
You may ask for this consent to be in writing if you feel it will help prevent misunderstandings.
You have discerned that there is clear evidence that the child understands the baptismal covenant and will make every effort to keep it through obeying the commandments, including faithfully attending Church meetings.
The child’s primary residence is not with parents who are polygamists.
If one or both of the child’s parents are polygamists, you must contact the mission president for additional information.
The baptism is not prohibited by local laws and culture.
Do I need permission of the spouse in order to baptize a husband or wife?
Yes.
Do not baptize a married person without the consent of his or her spouse.
If a parent in a family is not ready for baptism, should I baptize the family or wait until the parent is ready?
If a parent of a family is not ready for baptism and confirmation but other family members are, you may tell the parent you prefer not to baptize the family without him or her because the Church respects the wishes of the parents and because family members will progress in the gospel best as a family unit.
If the parent continues to decline, you may baptize and confirm other family members with his or her consent.
Is it a good idea to ordain a father to the Aaronic Priesthood immediately after baptism so that he can baptize other family members?
No.
The father must be confirmed in a sacrament meeting and, after an interview with the bishop, be sustained to receive the Aaronic Priesthood.
Baptisms of family members should not be delayed so that the father can receive the priesthood and perform the baptisms himself.
May I teach and baptize a person who has been excommunicated?
Baptisms of excommunicated persons are not convert baptisms, and missionaries do not interview such persons for baptism.
You may work with such persons only under the close supervision of the mission president and bishop.
What if a person has a scheduled baptismal date but is not keeping all of the commitments?
If you feel that someone you are teaching needs additional preparation, do not schedule a baptismal interview until he or she is keeping the commitments and meets the standards.
What do I do when people want to be baptized but are living together without being married?
Baptismal candidates who have been living with a person of the opposite gender out of wedlock must either marry or stop living together before they can be baptized.
Question 4 in the baptismal interview asks if a person has ever committed a serious crime (if so, are they on probation or parole), participated in an abortion, or committed a homosexual transgression.
What should I do if someone confesses such a sin?
Instructions for teaching missionaries.
Sometimes a person may volunteer information about such sins as you teach about the commandments and invite them to make commitments.
However, if they do not say anything but you think they may have a problem, prepare them for the baptismal interview by asking them if they have been involved in any of these sins.
If you become aware of a serious sin, do not ask about the details of the sin.
Do not schedule a baptismal date or make any promises about whether they will be cleared for baptism and confirmation.
Express your love and review the principle of repentance and forgiveness.
Kindly explain that these sins are serious and that a person with more maturity and experience (your mission president or someone he assigns) will talk with them and help them with these matters.
Always provide hope in Christ’s Atonement.
Then send a baptismal interview request directly to the mission president.
