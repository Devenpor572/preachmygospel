After the Baptism and Confirmation
Under the direction of the bishop, missionaries should continue to fellowship new members.
Continue to teach them and review what has been taught.
Encourage and support them, read the Book of Mormon with them, and help them share the gospel with family members and friends.
As appropriate, continue throughout your life to communicate with those whom you have taught and to encourage and support them.
After the confirmation, teach all five missionary lessons again.
Continue using the Teaching Record to record progress.
Work closely with the ward mission leader and ward leadership to help the new convert stay active, build trusted relationships with local members, receive a limited-use temple recommend, and be ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood (for males of the appropriate age).
Support new converts and help them receive all the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
