Confirmation
A person receives the ordinance of confirmation after he or she has been baptized (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:41 ).
A new convert is considered a member of the Church only after the ordinances of baptism and confirmation are both completed and properly recorded (see John 3:5 ; Doctrine and Covenants 33:11 ).
Converts are confirmed in a sacrament meeting in the ward where they live, preferably on the Sunday following their baptism.
Converts are not confirmed at the baptismal service.
The bishop is responsible for seeing that confirmation occurs as soon as reasonable after baptism.
At least one member of the bishopric participates in the confirmation.
The bishop should invite missionary elders who helped teach the convert to participate in the confirmation.
Work closely with the bishop and the ward mission leader to make sure this essential ordinance is performed.
The bishop does not conduct a separate interview for this ordinance.
After the confirmation, the bishop or ward clerk completes the confirmation information on the Baptism and Confirmation Form (Convert).
The ward clerk then returns two copies of the form to the missionaries.
The missionaries send one copy to the mission office for the creation of a membership record.
