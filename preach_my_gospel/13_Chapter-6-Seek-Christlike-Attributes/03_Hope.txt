Hope
Hope is not simply wishful thinking.
Instead, it is an abiding confidence, grounded in your faith in Christ, that God will fulfill His promises to you (see Moroni 7:42 ).
It is the expectation “of good things to come” through Christ ( Hebrews 9:11 ).
Your ultimate source of hope is Jesus Christ.
The prophet Mormon asked, “What is it that ye shall hope for?” He then answered, “Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise” ( Moroni 7:41 ; see verses 40–43 ).
As you center your hope in Christ, you have the assurance that all things will work together for your good (see Doctrine and Covenants 90:24 ).
This assurance helps you persevere with faith when you face trials.
It can also help you grow from trials and develop spiritual resilience and strength.
Hope in Christ provides an anchor for your soul (see Ether 12:4 ).
Hope gives you confidence that God will magnify your diligent, righteous efforts (see Doctrine and Covenants 123:17 ).
One way to increase hope is through repentance.
Becoming cleansed and forgiven through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ engenders and revives hope (see Alma 22:16 ).
Nephi exhorted, “Press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men” ( 2 Nephi 31:20 ).
As you live the gospel, you will grow in your ability to “abound in hope” ( Romans 15:13 ).
“In times of distress, we can hold tightly to the hope that things will ‘work together for [our] good’ as we follow the counsel of God’s prophets.
This type of hope in God, His goodness, and His power refreshes us with courage during difficult challenges and gives strength to those who feel threatened by enclosing walls of fear, doubt, and despair” (Dieter F.
Uchtdorf, “ The Infinite Power of Hope ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov.
2008, 23).
