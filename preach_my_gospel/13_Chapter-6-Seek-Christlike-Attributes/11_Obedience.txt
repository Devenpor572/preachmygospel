Obedience
Your service as a missionary is an extension of covenants you made with God at baptism and in the temple.
When you received the ordinances of baptism and the endowment, you covenanted that you would keep His commandments.
King Benjamin taught: “I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God.
For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness” ( Mosiah 2:41 ).
Obeying the commandments is an expression of love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ (see John 14:15 ).
Jesus said, “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love” ( John 15:10 ).
Follow the guidelines in Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ .
Also follow the counsel of your mission president and his wife as they counsel you in righteousness.
“Obedience is our choice.
The Savior made this clear.
As stated in the Joseph Smith Translation of Luke 14:28 , Jesus directed, ‘Wherefore, settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you.’ It is that simple.
… As we do so, our spiritual stability will be greatly enhanced.
We will avoid squandering God-given resources and making unproductive and destructive detours in our lives” (Dale G.
Renlund, “ Constructing Spiritual Stability ” [Brigham Young University devotional, Sept.
16, 2014], 2, speeches.byu.edu).
