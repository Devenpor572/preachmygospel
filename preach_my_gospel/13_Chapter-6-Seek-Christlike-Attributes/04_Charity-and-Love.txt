Charity and Love
A man once asked Jesus, “Which is the great commandment in the law?” Jesus replied: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” ( Matthew 22:36–39 ).
Charity is “the pure love of Christ” ( Moroni 7:47 ).
It includes God’s eternal love for all His children.
The prophet Mormon taught, “Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love” ( Moroni 7:48 ).
As you pray to have charity fill your heart, you will taste of God’s love.
Your love for people will increase, and you will come to feel a sincere concern for their eternal happiness.
You will see them as children of God with the potential of becoming like Him, and you will labor in their behalf.
As you pray for the gift of charity, you will be less inclined to dwell on negative feelings such as anger or envy.
You will become less likely to judge or criticize others.
You will have more desire to try to understand them and their points of view.
You will become more patient and try to help people when they are struggling or discouraged.
(See Moroni 7:45 .)
Charity, like faith, leads to action.
You strengthen it as you serve others and give of yourself.
Charity is transformative.
Heavenly Father bestows it “upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; … that when he shall appear we shall be like him, … that we may be purified even as he is pure” ( Moroni 7:48 ).
