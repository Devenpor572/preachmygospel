Knowledge
The Lord counseled, “Seek learning, even by study and also by faith” ( Doctrine and Covenants 88:118 ).
During your mission and throughout your life, seek knowledge, especially spiritual knowledge.
Study the scriptures every day, as well as the words of the living prophets.
Through study and prayer, seek help for specific questions, challenges, and opportunities.
Look for scripture passages you can use in teaching and in answering questions about the gospel.
As you study diligently and prayerfully, the Holy Ghost will enlighten your mind.
He will teach you and give you understanding.
He will help you apply the teachings of the scriptures and latter-day prophets in your life.
Like Nephi, you can say:
“My soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them.
… Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard” ( 2 Nephi 4:15–16 ).
