Diligence
Diligence is consistent, earnest effort.
In missionary work, diligence is an expression of your love for the Lord.
When you are diligent, you find joy and satisfaction in the Lord’s work (see Alma 26:16 ).
Diligence includes doing many good things of your own free will instead of waiting for leaders to tell you what to do (see Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–29 ).
Continue to do good even when it is hard or you are tired.
Yet recognize the need for balance and rest so you do not “run faster than [you have] strength” ( Mosiah 4:27 ).
Center your heart and interests on the Lord and His work.
Avoid things that distract you from your priorities.
Focus your time and efforts on the activities that will be most effective in your area and most helpful to the people you are teaching.
“This is the Lord’s Church.
He called us and trusted us even in the weaknesses He knew we had.
He knew the trials we would face.
By faithful service and through His Atonement, we can come to want what He wants and be what we must be to bless those we serve for Him.
As we serve Him long enough and with diligence, we will be changed.
We can become ever more like Him” (Henry B.
Eyring, “ Act in All Diligence ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2010, 62–63).
