Repentance and Addiction Recovery
Repentance is a spiritual process that involves humility, confession, restitution, and turning away from the sin.
It is a continual commitment to improve our thoughts and actions as we work to become more like the Savior.
Even when sins are repeated, repentance is available as a means of healing (see Mosiah 26:30 ; Moroni 6:8 ; Doctrine and Covenants 1:31–32 ).
Repentance may involve an emotional and physical process.
People must stop ongoing, ingrained ways of inappropriate acting.
Undesirable actions must be replaced with healthy and appropriate behaviors.
Sometimes converts, even with the best of intentions, give in to temptation as they progress toward greater self-discipline.
Thus, both repentance and recovery may take considerable time.
In such cases new converts seek the Lord’s help, and if necessary, work with their priesthood leaders (not with the missionaries) as they seek to overcome temptation and to fully repent.
Through baptism and confirmation people receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which will strengthen their ability to overcome these challenges.
But baptism and confirmation may not fully do away with the emotional and physical urges that go along with these behaviors.
Even though a person may have some initial success, further emotional healing may be necessary to completely repent and recover.
