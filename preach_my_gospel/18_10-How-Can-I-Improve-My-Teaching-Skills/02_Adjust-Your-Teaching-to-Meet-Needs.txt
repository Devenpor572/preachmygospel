Adjust Your Teaching to Meet Needs
Each person or family you teach is unique.
Even though you will not understand all of their interests, achievements, needs, and concerns, you should seek to be sensitive to their circumstances.
Regardless of needs or problems, all people are best helped as they accept and live the gospel.
You will be able to adjust your teaching as you listen to the promptings of the Spirit.
Let the Spirit guide the order in which you present the lessons based on the needs, interests, questions, and situations of those you teach.
You may use more than one meeting to teach the principles in one lesson, and occasionally you may teach the contents of two lessons in a single meeting.
Heavenly Father knows His children, so rely on inspiration to make these decisions as you teach.
Pray for the gift of discernment, and pay attention to thoughts that come to your mind or feelings you have about what to teach.
You will need to adjust your teaching to give more attention to those commitments that are more difficult for an individual to keep.
For example, one person may easily accept the Book of Mormon as the word of God, while another may struggle to accept anything but the Bible.
One person may have trouble giving up tobacco but will readily accept the law of tithing.
As you plan when to teach certain doctrinal principles, be sensitive about how much new information you share.
Teach at a pace that is appropriate for the person.
Some will progress faster or slower than others.
Make sure that you ask enough questions and listen carefully to their answers so you have a firm understanding of how quickly and how well they are learning and applying the doctrine you are presenting.
Be sensitive to time.
Most teaching appointments should not last beyond 45 minutes.
A teaching visit can be completed, however, in 15 or 20 minutes if needed.
If the person has only 15 minutes to meet with you, adjust your teaching to respect that limitation.
Trust in the promise that the Spirit will give you “in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say” ( Doctrine and Covenants 100:6 ).
Activity: Personal Study
Imagine that you are walking down the street and notice an older man struggling to place some heavy bags into a garbage can.
You and your companion help him, and as a result he asks who you are.
After some discussion he invites you into his home and agrees to hear your message.
During the initial conversation he tells you that:
His wife died a year ago, and he really misses her.
He tires easily because of a heart condition.
He wonders more now than ever before whether God exists.
What might you teach him?
How could you adjust your teaching to best meet his needs and concerns?
