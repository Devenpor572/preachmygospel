Leave Something Behind
At the conclusion of each teaching visit, provide the people you teach with something to read and ponder in preparation for the next meeting.
You might assign them chapters from the Book of Mormon to study or encourage them to use approved Church resources (both print and digital), such as Gospel Library, to find answers to a concern, research a topic, or watch a video.
The people you teach should always be given something to think about, to ponder, and to pray about.
This can become an opening topic of discussion the next time you meet.
Activity: Companion Study
Review the Church-approved items you have available to leave with people.
Are there other items you need to obtain so you can share them with the people you teach?
Make a list of the items you need to order.
Consider each person you are scheduled to teach this week.
What chapters in the Book of Mormon will be most helpful to them?
What other items would benefit them?
Record what you intend to provide each person and what you will do to follow up during your next visit.
