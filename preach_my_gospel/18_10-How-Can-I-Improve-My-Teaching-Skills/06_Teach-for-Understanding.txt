Teach for Understanding
People are better able to believe the message of the Restoration of the gospel when they understand the message.
President James E.
Faust said: “Study, ponder, and teach from the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon and the New Testament.
Know the truth so well that you can state it clearly.
B.
H.
Roberts wrote, ‘To be known, the truth must be stated and the clearer and more complete the statement is, the better the opportunity will the Holy Spirit have for testifying to the souls of men that the work is true.’ [ New Witnesses for God, 3 vols.
(1909), 2:vii].
You cannot convert people beyond your own conversion” (“ What I Want My Son to Know before He Leaves on His Mission ,” Ensign, May 1996, 41).
You are commanded to reason with and expound the scriptures when you teach (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:1 ).
Expound means to enlarge on and to explain clearly.
Expounding the gospel means that you explain the meaning of the doctrine and scriptural passages simply and clearly, relying on the Spirit to guide what you say.
Use dignified but conversational language to help people understand the doctrinal principles.
Ask questions to help them think about the principles and to see if they understand and accept what you have taught.
At the end of each of the first three lessons in chapter 3 is a list of words that may be unfamiliar to those you teach.
Part of teaching for understanding is to make sure you explain words, phrases, and ideas so that other people understand you better.
You can improve your ability to explain the gospel by:
Understanding the words you use.
Defining words others may not understand.
Many words that mean special things to members of the Church are defined simply in approved Church resources.
Asking people questions like, “Do you know what we mean when we say … ?” or “Can you restate what we just talked about in your own words?”
As you study the doctrine in chapter 3, identify words you think may be difficult for someone to understand.
As you teach the doctrine in chapter 3, make notes of words, phrases, and ideas that those you teach have a hard time understanding.
Define those words using the resources mentioned above.
Test your definitions with people you are teaching and recent converts.
