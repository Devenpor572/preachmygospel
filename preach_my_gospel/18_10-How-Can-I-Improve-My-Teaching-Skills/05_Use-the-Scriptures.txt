Use the Scriptures
The standard works of the Church are your basic sources for teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
You may also use the words of living prophets.
There are many reasons why it is vital to use the scriptures as the basis for your teaching.
For example:
The Lord and His prophets have instructed us to do so (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:12, 56–58 ; 71:1 ).
A latter-day prophet counseled, “The words and the way they are used in the Book of Mormon by the Lord … should be used by us in teaching gospel principles” (Ezra Taft Benson, “ The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants ,” Ensign, May 1987, 84).
The scriptures invite the Holy Ghost into your teaching.
They teach God’s word with power (see Alma 31:5 ).
The scriptures answer the great questions of the soul (see 2 Nephi 32:3 ; Jacob 2:8 ).
The scriptures give authority and validity to your teaching, even in areas without a Christian background.

Your ability to teach with power from the scriptures comes in large measure from the time you personally spend studying them.
As you daily feast upon the word, your ability to teach from the scriptures will improve.
In addition, your invitations to study and ponder the scriptures will be more powerful because you are doing the same thing in your life.
Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ through studying the scriptures—particularly the Book of Mormon—and to gain a testimony that the scriptures are sources of revealed truth.
When people come to believe the scriptures, you will be better able to help them understand the doctrine correctly.
The following suggestions may help.
Introduce the scripture.
Describe briefly the background and context of the passage you will use.
Invite those you teach to look for particular points in the passage.
When teaching people with a limited knowledge of the scriptures, you may need to begin by describing the contents of a passage, using language that they will understand.
Below are examples of introducing a scripture:
“Here in Joseph Smith’s history we have Joseph’s own words telling what happened to him as he went into the grove to pray.
He said, ‘I saw a pillar of light …’”
“In this passage the prophet Alma is teaching people who are poor to exercise their faith in the word of God.
He compares the word of God to a seed that can be planted in our hearts.
Will you begin reading verse …”
Read the passage.
Read the verses aloud or ask the person you are teaching to read aloud.
Be sensitive to those who struggle to read.
If a passage is difficult for them to understand, read with them carefully and help them understand the more difficult points.
Or give them a simpler passage to read.
You might also define difficult words or phrases:
“Let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not [’upbraideth not’ means that God won’t find blame or fault] and it shall be given him” ( James 1:5 ).
Some scriptural passages are clear and need no explanation.
For others you may take time to explain what has been read.
Apply the scripture.
“Liken” the scriptures to yourself and to those you teach by showing how the principles are relevant today (see 1 Nephi 19:23 ).
Show them how they can apply the principles in their lives.
As they do, they will come to know that the doctrine is true.
Bear your testimony of the principle, and promise them blessings.
For example:
“The people of Alma, like you, had heavy burdens placed on them, almost more than they could bear.
But as they exercised faith and ‘cried mightily to God,’ He strengthened them so they could endure the challenges and then delivered them from their trials.
Just as He did with these people, I know God will help you in your trials as you …”
“Alma’s instruction to the people at the waters of Mormon applies to us today.
John, are you willing to …”
The people you teach will differ widely in how they view sacred texts, how familiar they are with the Bible, how well they understand scriptural language, and how deeply they believe that the Bible contains God’s word.
Help all people gain an appreciation for the scriptures.
By effectively using the scriptures in your teaching, you can help them begin to study the scriptures on their own.
After each visit, suggest specific chapters or verses for them to read.
You might give them questions to consider as they read, which you can discuss in your next meeting.
This will encourage them to study the scriptures daily in their homes and participate in Church meetings and classes where the scriptures are used.
Cultural Views of Scriptures
Most religions have sacred texts or books of scripture, but their use and perception of them may be different from how members of the Church view scriptures.
For example, you may need to explain that your marking of scriptures is evidence of your desire to understand and apply the teachings of the scriptures and is not a sign of disrespect.
Help those you teach see that the standard works are important because they contain the word of the Lord as written by prophets of God and that we accept them as truth.
