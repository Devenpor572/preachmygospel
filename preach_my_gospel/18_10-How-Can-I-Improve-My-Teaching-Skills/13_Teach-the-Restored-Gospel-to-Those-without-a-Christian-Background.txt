Teach the Restored Gospel to Those without a Christian Background
Some of the people whom you will teach may not believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ or have a Christian tradition.
Many of these people, however, will have beliefs, practices, and places which they hold sacred.
As a servant of God, it is essential that you show proper respect for their religious beliefs and traditions.
Do not do anything that would show disrespect for that which is important to them.
You may wonder how you should adjust your teaching approach for these people.
It will be helpful to remember that in order to be converted, all of God’s children, regardless of background, must develop faith in Jesus Christ, repent, receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, and endure to the end by keeping the commandments and giving service.
The principles that help others build faith in Jesus Christ are the same in all cultures.
You can find valuable resources for teaching those without a Christian background in Gospel Library under the “Missionary” section.
You can help people gain a correct understanding of God as our Heavenly Father and develop faith in Jesus Christ by helping them have personal spiritual experiences rather than simply telling them about the nature of God.
For example, you will help people gain this understanding as they:
Gain a spiritual conviction that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith.
Hear your sincere teaching and testimony of the gospel, including why you chose to follow Jesus Christ.
Frequently hear you and other members talk to Heavenly Father in a simple, heartfelt prayer.
Hear you bear powerful testimony.
Pray with you and on their own.
Come to learn how you feel about the scriptures as you read and discuss them.
Read God’s word from the scriptures daily (especially the Book of Mormon).
Attend church so they can see how we worship the Lord.
Meet members of the Church who can explain how they came to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
Keep the commandments.
These activities are beneficial for all people you teach, but they are essential when teaching those without a Christian background because these people are less likely to have had these experiences previously.
Many converts from non-Christian backgrounds report that they did not understand much of what the missionaries were saying but that they felt the Spirit and wanted to do what the missionaries asked.
Do all you can to help people understand the doctrine of the gospel.
Be patient and supportive, as it may take some time for people to learn to identify and express the feelings they have inside.
You may need to adjust the pace and depth of your teaching to help them understand.
As you prepare to teach those without a Christian background, the following suggestions may help:
Provide simple overviews and reviews for each lesson.
Ask them to tell you what they understand and what they have experienced.
Take the time to define essential words and principles.
Those you teach may not be familiar with many of the words you will use as you teach.
Return to a previously taught lesson to teach the doctrine more clearly.
This may be necessary any time in the teaching process.

Activity: Companion Study
When possible, identify a convert who was not part of a Christian tradition before meeting with the missionaries.
Arrange to meet with him or her, and ask about his or her conversion experience.
For example, you might ask what led the person to believe in God, the first time he or she prayed, the first time he or she felt an answer to prayer, the role of the scriptures in his or her conversion, and what it was like to attend Sunday services.
Write what you learn in your study journal.
