A central purpose of the Book of Mormon is to convince all people that Jesus is the Christ (see title page of the Book of Mormon ).
It testifies of Christ by affirming the reality of His life, mission, and power.
It teaches true doctrine concerning Christ’s Atonement —the foundation for the plan of salvation.
Several of those whose writings are preserved in the Book of Mormon saw Christ personally.
The brother of Jared, Nephi, and Jacob saw the premortal Christ.
Mormon and Moroni saw the risen Christ.
In addition, multitudes were present during the Savior’s brief but powerful ministry among the Nephites (see 3 Nephi 11–28 ).
Those who know little or nothing about the Savior will come to know Him by reading, pondering, and praying about the Book of Mormon.
The testimony of the Book of Mormon confirms the testimony of the Bible that Jesus is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior of the world.
As you teach the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you will testify often about the Savior and Redeemer of the world.
By the power of the Holy Ghost, you will add your living witness of the truthfulness of this message.
