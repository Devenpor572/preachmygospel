The Book of Mormon and the Bible Support Each Other
People’s beliefs about the Bible vary widely.
Some believe that the Bible is absolutely perfect, without error, and that it is all we need to be saved.
Others think the Bible is literature worth studying, but they deny that it is evidence of Christ’s divinity and miracles or direct revelation from God.
Some choose to ignore the Bible, and others have never seen the Bible or had a chance to read it.
Latter-day Saints “believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly” ( Articles of Faith 1:8 ).
Far from competing with the Bible, the Book of Mormon supports it, exhorts us to read it, and testifies of the truthfulness of its message.
You should use the Book of Mormon and the Bible to support one another.
The Book of Mormon speaks of the ancient covenants God made with His children; the Bible tells of great prophets who also received these covenants by faith.
The Book of Mormon testifies of Christ and His Atonement; the Bible provides the account of His birth, ministry, death, Atonement, and Resurrection.
Thus, the Bible and Book of Mormon complement and enrich each other.
The LDS English edition of the King James Version of the Bible and the Book of Mormon have cross-references and study aids that make the stick of Judah (the Bible) and the stick of Joseph (the Book of Mormon) one in our hands (see Ezekiel 37:15–17 ; see also 1 Nephi 13:34–41 ; 2 Nephi 3:12 ; 29:8 ).
Give priority to Book of Mormon passages when you teach, but also show how the Book of Mormon and the Bible teach the same principles.
Use the Book of Mormon to clarify and explain Bible passages.
For example, the New Testament states that Christ was baptized to “fulfil all righteousness” ( Matthew 3:14–15 ).
The Book of Mormon explains what it means to fulfill all righteousness (see 2 Nephi 31:5–9 ).
As you use the Book of Mormon and the Bible as companion volumes of scripture, they will overcome contention and correct false doctrine (see 2 Nephi 3:12 ).
The Bible teaches the following about the law of witnesses: “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established” ( 2 Corinthians 13:1 ).
In harmony with this law, both the Book of Mormon and the Bible testify of Jesus Christ.
