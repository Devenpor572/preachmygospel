The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion.
It provides powerful evidence for the divinity of Christ.
It is also proof of the Restoration through the Prophet Joseph Smith.
An essential part of conversion is receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true.
As a missionary, you must first have a personal testimony that the Book of Mormon is true.
This testimony can lead to a deep and abiding faith in the power of the Book of Mormon during the conversion process.
Have confidence that the Holy Ghost will testify to anyone who reads and ponders the Book of Mormon and asks God if it is true with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ.
This witness of the Holy Ghost should be a central focus of your teaching.
