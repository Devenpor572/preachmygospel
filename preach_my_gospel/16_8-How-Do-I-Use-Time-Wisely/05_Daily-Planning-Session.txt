Daily Planning Session
With your companion, hold a planning session each morning.
Apply the same principles and guidelines in a daily planning session that you follow in a weekly session but in a simpler way.
Be prayerful as you discuss the lessons or topics you can study during personal and companion study time that will help you with your plan.
Write these topics in the lined space provided on the Daily Goals and Plans page.
Review your daily schedule.
Have a meaningful activity planned for every hour of the day.
During your Sunday planning session, account for the progress of the people you are teaching in order to report to your mission president and finalize your goals for the coming week.
Always pray before leaving your apartment.
Throughout the day, review your goals, plans, and schedule, and make adjustments as needed.
You can tell how effective your daily plans are when you don’t need to ask others, “Now what should I do?”
