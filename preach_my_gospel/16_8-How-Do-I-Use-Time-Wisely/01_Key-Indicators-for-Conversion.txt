Key Indicators for Conversion
Perhaps you have wondered which of your many duties are the most important.
To be able to answer this question, you must understand your purpose and know how effective use of time can help you fulfill this purpose.
Your purpose is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
Key indicators have been identified by Church leaders to help you focus on this purpose.
As you focus on these indicators, you will help people progress toward baptism, confirmation, continued activity in the Church, and lasting conversion.
Key Indicators to Record and Report
People baptized and confirmed
People with a baptismal date
People who attended sacrament meeting
New people being taught

These indicators identify events and conditions that show a personâ€™s progress toward enduring conversion.
A brief description of each key indicator is given below.
People baptized and confirmed: Each convert who has received the ordinances of baptism and confirmation.
People with a baptismal date: Each person who has agreed to be baptized and confirmed on specific dates.
People who attended sacrament meeting: Each person (not baptized) you are teaching who has attended sacrament meeting.
New people being taught: The total number of people (not baptized) who have received a lesson and accepted a specific return appointment.
A lesson typically includes a prayer (when appropriate), the teaching of at least one gospel principle or topic, and extending appropriate invitations.
As you set goals and make plans, evaluate what you do in terms of how your efforts will add to the numbers of people represented in each of these key indicators.
Your goal should be to have increasing numbers for every key indicator.
You will do many things that are not described in the key indicators, such as street contacting or personal and companion study.
These important activities contribute to one or more of the key indicators.
For example, when you teach those you find through your own efforts, you add new people to your teaching pool.
Also, the quality of your personal and companion study will improve your ability to teach by the Spirit, blessing the people you are teaching.
The power of your finding and teaching will influence every key indicator.
Evaluate all you do based on whether it adds to the numbers of people in these categories.
If you and your companion cannot see how a missionary activity might help increase the numbers of people in one or more key indicators, you need to question whether the activity is worth your time.
Activity: Companion Study
In your study journal, list every missionary activity you have done in the past three days.
For each activity, determine if it influenced one of the key indicators.
If it did, write yes beside it.
If it did not, write no.
For each activity with a yes, describe how it had an impact.
For each activity with a no, decide why you did it and whether you will continue to do the activity in the future.
Discuss your list with your companion, and explain why you marked some activities yes and some activities no.
Discuss which activities you may need to stop doing.
