Accountability
“When performance is measured, performance improves.
When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.”

The principle of accountability is fundamental in God’s eternal plan.
We will all stand before the Lord at the last judgment and give an accounting for what we have done with the opportunities He has given us (see Alma 5:15–19 ; Doctrine and Covenants 137:9 ).
There is much you can learn about accountability on your mission that will benefit you throughout your life.
The principle of accountability will bless you if you:
Approach your goal setting and planning with the idea that you will account for your efforts to your mission leaders and to the Lord through prayer.
Feel personal responsibility for the sacred trust the Lord has given you.
Set meaningful goals.
Choose to be proactive in accounting for your work to the Lord and to your mission leaders.
Don’t wait to be asked.
Don’t require others to follow up with you frequently.
Have a desire to account for your labor.
Accept full responsibility for your efforts.
Never blame others for difficult circumstances or lack of progress.
Seek to learn from your leaders, and invite them to suggest ways you can improve.
Be motivated to do your best work.
Accountability does not come only at the end of your mission.
It is a principle that influences how you begin, how you think and feel about the responsibility the Lord has given you, how you approach your work, and how well you endure.
The attitude you have toward your mission experience is a reflection of your love toward your Heavenly Father and His Son and your respect for the priesthood.
As you pray personally and in your companionship, seek inspiration on what you should do each day.
As you follow your plans, pray and ask the Lord for guidance.
Have a prayer in your heart throughout the day that the Spirit will help you know where to go, what to do, and what to say.
Ask yourself, “What more can I do?” In your prayer at the end of the day, give an accounting of your work.
You will give an accounting each week to your mission leaders during your weekly report, during district council, and in other settings throughout the week.
If you are a mission leader, you will receive this information from other missionaries.
Show an interest in their lives and in the lives of those they teach rather than simply in numbers.
Do not use these tools or the information you receive as ways to control or manipulate.
The information you receive through these tools will provide you with opportunities to praise missionaries for their dedication and to see opportunities for future training.
