How to Set Goals
Goals reflect the desires of our hearts and our vision of what we can accomplish.
Through goals and plans, our hopes are transformed into action.
Goal setting and planning are acts of faith.
Prayerfully set goals that are in harmony with the Savior’s command to “teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” ( Matthew 28:19 ).
Set goals for each key indicator.
You may also set goals for your personal development.
Do everything within your power to achieve your goals while respecting the agency of others.
The ultimate measure of success is not in achieving goals alone but in the service you render and the progress of others.
Goals are a means of helping you bring about much good among Heavenly Father’s children.
They are not to be used to receive recognition.
“I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don’t set goals in our life and learn how to master the techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential.
When one learns to master the principles of setting a goal, he will then be able to make a great difference in the results he attains in this life.”

Carefully considered goals will give you clear direction and will help you fill your days with activities that help people strengthen their faith in the Savior and progress toward baptism, confirmation, and full activity in the Church.
Challenging goals will help you work effectively and lead you to stretch and grow.
Follow the guidelines below as you set goals:
Follow the Spirit.
Focus on the people, keeping in mind the key indicators for conversion.
Although you will use numbers, be able to support your numbers with the names of people where possible.
Be specific and realistic, but set goals that will make you stretch.
Set daily, weekly, and monthly goals.
Goals for key indicators are reported through the Missionary Portal or digital tools.
Set goals for personal and companion study, including language study if you are learning another language.
Measure your progress each day, each week, and each month.
When you fall short of a goal, evaluate your efforts and seek for ways to accomplish the goal.
If needed, adjust your expectations.
Over time your mission president may establish standards of excellence or mission goals intended to raise your vision and increase your faith.
District, zone, and mission standards will help you stretch, work effectively, and reach higher levels of performance.
They are not to be used as quotas that impose specific goals on you and your companion.
Activity: Companion Study
Set weekly goals for each indicator and a monthly goal for people baptized and confirmed.
For each goal, ask yourselves:
Are there names associated with the number?
Is the goal specific?
Is the goal realistic?
Will the goal make us stretch?
Are we committed to this goal?
Discuss each goal.
If necessary, determine how you might revise it and why.
