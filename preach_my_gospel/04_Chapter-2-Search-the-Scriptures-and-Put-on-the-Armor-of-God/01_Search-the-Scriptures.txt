Search the Scriptures
Jesus Christ “is the life and the light of the world.
Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness” ( Alma 38:9 ; see also John 1 ).
Studying the word of God in the holy scriptures will bring abundance to your life (see John 10:10 ).
His words will fill you—and those you teach—with light and truth.
They will help you—and those you teach—live righteously and receive divine protection and strength.
They will help you come to know Him and taste His love, which is sweet above all that is sweet.
His words will fill your soul with joy ( 1 Nephi 8:11–12 ; see verses 1–34 ).
The scriptures are a heavenly gift.
One of the great blessings of your mission is having a scheduled time to study them every day.
Gospel study is one of the most rewarding kinds of spiritual work you can do.
It is invigorating both mentally and spiritually.
As Alma taught, when you “plant” the word of God in your heart, it will “enlighten [your] understanding” and become delicious to you ( Alma 32:28 ; see also Enos 1:3–4 ).
As you continue to study and apply God’s word, it will “take root; and … be a tree springing up unto everlasting life” ( Alma 32:41 ; see also verses 42–43 ).
Your knowledge and testimony of the gospel will increase.
Your desire and ability to share the gospel will also increase.
Learning from a good teacher is important, but it is also important for you to have meaningful learning experiences from your own study of the scriptures.
This is also true for the people you teach.
Understanding the scriptures may be challenging at first.
However, as you patiently persist in studying the word of God, your understanding will grow.
You will come to treasure your time with the scriptures.
You will eagerly look forward to what you will learn and experience.
Coming to know and love the scriptures can be a great lifelong blessing of your missionary service.
As you experience the blessings of scripture study during your mission, you will want to continue for the rest of your life.
“The central purpose of all scripture is to fill our souls with faith in God the Father and in His Son, Jesus Christ—faith that They exist; faith in the Father’s plan for our immortality and eternal life; faith in the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, which animates this plan of happiness; faith to make the gospel of Jesus Christ our way of life; and faith to come to know ‘the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom [He has] sent’ ( John 17:3 )” (D.
Todd Christofferson, “ The Blessing of Scripture ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2010, 34).

Seek the Spirit
Learning the gospel is much more than gaining information.
It is also a spiritual process of applying eternal truth under the guidance of the Holy Ghost (see Jacob 4:8 ; Doctrine and Covenants 50:19–25 ).
Seek and trust the Spirit to teach you as you study the scriptures.
This will happen to the degree that you liken the scriptures to yourself with real intent to act on what you learn (see 1 Nephi 19:23 ; Moroni 10:4 ; Joseph Smith—History 1:18 ).
Prayerfully studying the scriptures will open a window of revelation for the Spirit to speak to your mind and heart.
He will bless you with guidance, inspiration, and answers to your questions.
Through your study of the scriptures, the Holy Ghost will strengthen and comfort you.
He will give you knowledge and conviction that will bless your life and enable you to bless others eternally.

Look for Answers to Questions
As a missionary, you will hear many questions.
You will also have questions of your own.
Searching the scriptures and other approved resources for answers to these questions is a powerful way to study.
Record the questions and what you learn and feel in your study journal.
Use accurate, reliable sources in your study—primarily the scriptures, the words of the living prophets, and Preach My Gospel .
Use the resources in Gospel Library, such as the Guide to the Scriptures , Bible Dictionary , index to the triple combination, Gospel Topics , and Gospel Topics essays .
Learn which resources are available in the languages of the people you teach.
“One thing I have learned in life is how frequently the Lord answers our questions and gives us counsel through the scriptures.
… Let us then go to the Lord in prayer, pleading for help or answers; and those answers will come as we open the scriptures and begin to study them.
Sometimes it is as though a passage hundreds or thousands of years old was dictated specifically to answer our question” (M.
Russell Ballard, “ Be Strong in the Lord, and in the Power of His Might ” [Brigham Young University fireside, Mar.
3, 2002], 5, speeches.byu.edu).
Live What You Learn
As you feel the joy that comes from growing in understanding the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn.
Strive to live in harmony with what you learn.
Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony.
Acting on what you learn will bring added and enduring understanding.
(See John 7:17 .)
“True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior.
The study of the [doctrine] of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior” (Boyd K.
Packer, “ Little Children ,” Ensign , Nov.
1986, 17).
