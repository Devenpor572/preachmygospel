Put on the Armor of God
Your ability to resist temptation will increase as you study and apply the scriptures, the words of the living prophets, Preach My Gospel , Missionary Standards for Disciples of Jesus Christ , and the safeguards outlined in this chapter.
By putting on the “whole armour of God,” you will be able to discern truth from error.
You will have your feet shod with the “gospel of peace.” Putting “on the breastplate of righteousness” will protect you.
With the “shield of faith,” you will be able to quench the fiery darts of the adversary.
You will take “the sword of [His] Spirit” to teach truth with power and authority.
You will be fortified against worldly influences that could otherwise lead you to become adrift, isolated, and even alienated.
