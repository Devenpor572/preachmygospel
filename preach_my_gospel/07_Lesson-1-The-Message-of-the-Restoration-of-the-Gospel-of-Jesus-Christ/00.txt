Your Purpose
As you teach, help people prepare for baptism and confirmation.
Consider the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the related baptismal interview questions .
Prayerfully decide what to teach and which invitations to extend based on the person’s needs, interests, and situation.
Be mindful of the questions and level of understanding of those you teach.
