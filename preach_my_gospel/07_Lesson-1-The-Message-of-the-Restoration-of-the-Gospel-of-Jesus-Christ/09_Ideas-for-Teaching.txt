Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes)
Our message is remarkable and simple.
God is our Father.
We are His children.
We are part of His family.
He loves us.
From the beginning of the world, He has followed a pattern of love and concern.
Many times He has reached out in love to reveal the gospel of Jesus Christ so that His children can know how to return to Him.
He revealed it to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses.
But people have repeatedly chosen to reject that gospel.
Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ Himself taught His gospel and established His Church, and accomplished the Atonement.
Incredibly, people even rejected Jesus.
Whenever people disregard or distort true doctrine and ordinances, God withdraws His authority to administer the Church.
Our invitation to you and all people is to add to the truths you already treasure.
Consider our evidence that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have again reached out to God’s children in love and revealed the fulness of the gospel to a prophet.
This prophet’s name is Joseph Smith.
The evidence of this glorious truth is found in a book—the Book of Mormon—which you can read, ponder, and pray about.
If you pray with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, God will tell you by the power of the Holy Ghost that it is true.

Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes)
God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father
We are God’s children (see Acts 17:29 ).
God loves us and will help us make right choices.
Through Jesus Christ, we can live with God again (see John 3:16–17 ).
The Gospel Blesses Individuals and Families
The gospel of Jesus Christ blesses individuals and helps families develop stronger relationships.
Families are ordained of God; they are the most important social unit in time and eternity (see Doctrine and Covenants 49:15–16 ).
The family is the best place to teach, learn, and apply gospel principles (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:25 ; Genesis 18:19 ; Deuteronomy 6:7 ).
The family can be a place of safety, peace, and joy.
Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every Dispensation
God calls prophets to teach His gospel (see Amos 3:7 ).
Apostasy means to reject prophets and the gospel.
Dispensations are periods of time when prophets have taught the gospel.
Previous dispensations have ended in apostasy (see Doctrine and Covenants 136:36–38 ).
Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other ancient prophets all taught the gospel (see Moses 5:4–12 ).
The Savior’s Earthly Ministry and Atonement
The Son of God restored and taught the gospel.
He performed many miracles (see Bible Dictionary, “Miracles” ).
He called Apostles and gave them priesthood authority to preach the gospel and perform saving ordinances such as baptism (see John 15:16 ).
Christ established His Church.
Christ was crucified, and His Apostles were rejected and killed (see Matthew 27:35 ; Mark 15:25 ).
Christ accomplished the Atonement (see Bible Dictionary, “ Atonement ”).
The Great Apostasy
Without revelation through a prophet, people fall into spiritual darkness (see Amos 8:11–12 ).
Prophets and apostles foretold the Great Apostasy (see 2 Thessalonians 2:1–3 ).
The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith
Joseph sought for truth (see Joseph Smith—History 1:8, 10 ).
God and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith—History 1:16–17 ).
Like prophets in earlier dispensations, Joseph Smith was called as the prophet of this last dispensation.
God restored the fulness of the gospel through Joseph Smith (see Doctrine and Covenants 35:17 ; 135:3 ).
Other heavenly messengers restored the priesthood, and Christ’s Church was organized (see Doctrine and Covenants 13 ; 27:12 ).
A living prophet directs the Church today.
The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ
The Book of Mormon is convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet.
Joseph translated the plates by the power of God (see introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraph 5 ).
The Book of Mormon proves that God inspires prophets in our day as He has in every dispensation (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:5–12 ).
The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:8–9 ).
Pray to Know the Truth through the Holy Ghost
You can know that the Book of Mormon is true (see Moroni 10:3–5 ; introduction to the Book of Mormon, paragraphs 1, 8–9 ).
The Holy Ghost will teach you through your thoughts and feelings (see Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3 ).

Key Definitions
Agency: The ability and privilege God gives people to choose and to act for themselves.
Apostasy: A turning away from the truth by individuals, the Church, or entire nations.
It includes rebellion against authority and rejection of prophets.
Evidence of apostasy includes transgressing God’s laws, changing gospel ordinances, and breaking covenants (see Isaiah 24:5 ).
Dispensation: A period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood.
In addition to Jesus Christ, prophets such as Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Joseph Smith have each started a new gospel dispensation.
When the Lord organizes a dispensation, the gospel is revealed anew so that the people of that dispensation do not have to depend on past dispensations for knowledge of the plan of salvation.
The dispensation begun by Joseph Smith is known as the “dispensation of the fulness of times.”
Priesthood: The authority and power that God gives to man to act in the name of Jesus Christ in all things for the salvation of mankind.
Prophet: A man who has been called by and speaks for God.
As a messenger of God, a prophet receives priesthood authority, commandments, prophecies, and revelations from God.
His responsibility is to make known God’s will and true character to mankind and to show the meaning of His dealings with them.
A prophet denounces sin and foretells its consequences.
He is a preacher of righteousness.
On occasion, a prophet may be inspired to foretell the future for the benefit of mankind.
His primary responsibility, however, is to bear witness of Christ.
Redeemer: Jesus Christ is the great Redeemer of mankind because He, through His Atonement, paid the price for the sins of mankind and made possible the Resurrection of all people.
To redeem is to deliver, to purchase, or to ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment.
Redemption refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin.
Jesus’s Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death.
Through His Atonement, which includes His suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross as well as His Resurrection, those who have faith in Him and who repent are redeemed from spiritual death.
Reformer: To reform is to make changes to something in order to improve it.
The term reformers refers to those men and women (such as Martin Luther , William Tyndale , and John Wycliffe ) who protested the practices of the existing church, which they felt needed to be reformed.
Restoration: To restore means to return to a former condition, or to bring back.
The Restoration, as used by Latter-day Saints, means that the true Church of Jesus Christ, which was lost through apostasy, was brought back as it originally existed when organized by Jesus Christ.
Unlike the Reformation, the Restoration was accomplished by divine authority through revelation.
Revelation: Communication from God to His children on earth.
Revelation may come through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost by way of inspiration, visions, dreams, or visits by angels.
Revelation provides guidance that can lead the faithful to eternal salvation in the celestial kingdom.
The Lord reveals His work to His prophets and confirms to believers that the revelations to the prophets are true (see Amos 3:7 ).
Through revelation, the Lord provides individual guidance for every person who seeks it and who has faith, repents, and is obedient to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Buddha (Gotama):
Born in 563 B.C.
of a Hindu chieftain in Nepal.
