The Gospel Blesses Individuals and Families
The restored gospel of Jesus Christ blesses individuals and families.
It helps husbands and wives, parents and children as they strive to develop stronger relationships and spiritual strength in their families.
These blessings are available now and in eternity.
The gospel of Jesus Christ provides help with current concerns and challenges.
The message of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that all individuals are part of Godâ€™s family and that families can be united now and in eternity.
Because families are ordained of God, they are the most important social unit in time and in eternity.
God has established families to bring happiness to His children, allow them to learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere, and prepare them for eternal life.
The home is the best place to teach, learn, and apply principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety.
It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide, blessing family members with peace, joy, and happiness.
Through prophets in every age, including our own, God has revealed His plan of happiness for individuals and families.
