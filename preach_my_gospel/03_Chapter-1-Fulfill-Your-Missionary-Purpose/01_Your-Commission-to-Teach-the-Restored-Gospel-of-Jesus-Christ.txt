Your Commission to Teach the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ
You are surrounded by people.
You pass them on the street and travel among them.
You visit them in their homes and connect with them online.
They are all children of God—your brothers and sisters.
God loves them just as He loves you.
Many of these people are searching for purpose in life.
They are concerned for their future and their families.
They need the sense of belonging that comes from knowing they are children of God and members of His eternal family.
They want to feel secure in a world of changing values.
They desire “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” ( Doctrine and Covenants 59:23 ).
Many are “only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” ( Doctrine and Covenants 123:12 ).
The gospel of Jesus Christ, as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, provides eternal truth.
This truth addresses people’s spiritual needs and helps them fulﬁll their deepest desires.
As an authorized representative of Jesus Christ, you teach that “redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah” ( 2 Nephi 2:6 ).
You invite people to come unto Christ to become converted to Him and His restored gospel.
As they accept your invitation, they will have greater happiness, hope, peace, and purpose.
To come to the Savior, people need to have faith in Him.
You can help them develop this faith as you:
Teach them the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and testify of its truth.
Invite them to commit to live according to its teachings.
Follow up and help them act on the commitments they make.
Help them have experiences in which they feel the influence of the Holy Ghost (see 1 Nephi 10:17–19 ).
Faith in Jesus Christ will lead people to repent.
By atoning for our sins, Jesus makes repentance possible.
As people repent, they will be cleansed from sin and grow closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
They will experience the joy and peace of receiving forgiveness.
Repentance prepares people for the covenant of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost.
“Come unto me,” the Savior said, “and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day” ( 3 Nephi 27:20 ).
As your understanding and testimony of the Savior and His Atonement grow, your desire to share the gospel will increase.
You will feel, as Lehi did, the “great … importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth” ( 2 Nephi 2:8 ).
