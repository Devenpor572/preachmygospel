Establish and Build Up the Church
When Jesus Christ restored His Church, He instructed the Prophet Joseph Smith and others to “establish” it and “build [it] up” ( Doctrine and Covenants 31:7 ; 39:13 ).
The Church is established and built up as people with testimonies are baptized and confirmed, keep their covenants, prepare to go to the temple, and help strengthen their ward or branch.
As a missionary, you help establish and build up the Savior’s Church.
There are many ways you can do this.
You can support members as they share the gospel through the principles of loving, sharing, and inviting (see General Handbook , 23.1 ).
You can help people receive baptism and grow in their faith.
You can help new members adjust to their new life and continue to grow spiritually.
You can also help returning members strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ.
New and returning members grow in testimony and faith when they experience the gospel working in their lives.
To help bring this about, it is important that they:
Have friends who are Church members.
Are given a responsibility in the Church.
Are nourished by God’s word.
(See Gordon B.
Hinckley, “ Converts and Young Men ,” Ensign , May 1997, 47.)
Missionaries, local leaders, and other Church members should gladly accept the opportunity to nourish and strengthen new and returning members.
This service helps “keep them in the right way” ( Moroni 6:4 ).
