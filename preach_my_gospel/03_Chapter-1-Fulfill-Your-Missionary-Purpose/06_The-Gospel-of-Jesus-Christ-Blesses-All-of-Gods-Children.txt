The Gospel of Jesus Christ Blesses All of God’s Children
The gospel of Jesus Christ is for all of God’s children.
The scriptures teach that “all are alike” unto God.
He invites “all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him” ( 2 Nephi 26:33 ).
The gospel blesses us throughout our mortal lives and throughout eternity.
We are most likely to be happy—both as individuals and as families—when we live by the teachings of Jesus Christ (see Mosiah 2:41 ; “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org).
Living the gospel deepens our joys, inspires our actions, and enriches our relationships.
One of the great messages of the restored gospel is that we are all part of God’s family.
We are His beloved sons and daughters.
Regardless of our family situation on earth, each of us is a member of the family of God.
Another great part of our message is that families can be united for eternity.
The family is ordained of God.
Latter-day prophets have taught:
“[Heavenly Father’s] divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave.
Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally” (“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ”).
Many people have limited opportunities for marriage or for loving family relationships.
Many have experienced divorce and other difficult family circumstances.
However, the gospel blesses us individually regardless of our family circumstance.
As we are faithful, God will provide a way for us to have the blessings of loving families, whether in this life or in the life to come (see Mosiah 2:41 ).
