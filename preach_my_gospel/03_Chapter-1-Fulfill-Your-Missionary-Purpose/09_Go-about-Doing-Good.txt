Go about Doing Good
During His mortal ministry, the Savior served others.
He went about “doing good” and “preaching the gospel” ( Acts 10:38 ; Matthew 4:23 ).
As you follow His example, you will find people you can serve and who will receive you.
Through service, you fulfill the two great commandments to love God and love your neighbor (see Matthew 22:36–40 ; 25:40 ; Mosiah 2:17 ).
Through service, you and others may come together in a powerful, inspiring way.
As a missionary, you give planned service each week (see Missionary Standards , 2.7 and 7.2 , for information and guidelines).
Under the direction of your mission president, you may find opportunities to serve in the community through JustServe (where it is approved) and the Church’s humanitarian and disaster response efforts.
Throughout each day, pray and look for unplanned opportunities to do good.
Listen to the Spirit to recognize occasions for small acts of kindness you can offer.
“Do you want to be happy?
Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause.
Lend your efforts to helping people.
… Stand higher, lift those with feeble knees, hold up the arms of those that hang down.
Live the gospel of Jesus Christ” (Gordon B.
Hinckley, Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Gordon B.
Hinckley [2016], 209 ).
