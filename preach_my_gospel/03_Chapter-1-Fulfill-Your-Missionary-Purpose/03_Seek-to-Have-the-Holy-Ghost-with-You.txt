Seek to Have the Holy Ghost with You
You received the gift of the Holy Ghost when you were confirmed a member of the Church.
As a missionary—and throughout your life—one of your greatest needs will be to have the Holy Ghost with you (see 1 Nephi 10:17 ; 3 Nephi 19:9 ).
The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead.
The Holy Ghost guides, teaches, and comforts you.
He cleanses and sanctifies you.
He testifies of truth and bears witness of the Father and the Son.
He brings about your conversion and the conversion of those you teach.
(See 3 Nephi 27:20 ; 28:11 ; Ether 12:41 ; Moroni 8:26 ; 10:5 ; John 15:26 .)
The Holy Ghost “will show unto you all things what ye should do” ( 2 Nephi 32:5 ).
He will magnify your abilities and service far beyond what you could do on your own.
Seeking to have the Holy Ghost with you should be one of your most earnest desires.
You will feel of His companionship as you:
Pray (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:14 ).
Treasure up God’s word (see Doctrine and Covenants 11:21 ; 84:85 ).
Purify your heart (see Doctrine and Covenants 112:28 ).
Keep the commandments (see Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21 ).
Partake of the sacrament each week (see Moroni 4–5 ; Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ).
“I plead with you to increase your spiritual capacity to receive revelation.
… Choose to do the spiritual work required to enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost and hear the voice of the Spirit more frequently and more clearly” (Russell M.
Nelson, “ Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 96).
Learn to Recognize the Spirit
You will better fulfill your missionary purpose as you learn to recognize and follow guidance from the Holy Ghost.
The Spirit usually communicates quietly, through your feelings and thoughts.
Devote yourself to seeking, recognizing, and following these subtle promptings.
They come in many ways (see chapter 4 ; see also Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3 ; 11:12–14 ; Galatians 5:22–23 ).
Teach by the Spirit
The gospel of Jesus Christ is “the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth” ( Romans 1:16 ).
For that reason, the message of the Restoration of the gospel needs to be taught by divine power—the power of the Holy Ghost.
The Lord said, “The Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” ( Doctrine and Covenants 42:14 ; see also 50:13–14, 17–22 ).
As you teach by the power of the Holy Ghost, He will:
Teach you truth and bring the doctrine you have studied to your remembrance (see John 14:26 ).
Give you words to speak when you need them (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:85 ).
Carry your message unto the hearts of the people you teach (see 2 Nephi 33:1 ).
Help you—and those who receive by the Spirit—to understand each other and be edified and rejoice together (see Doctrine and Covenants 50:17–22 ).
Testify of the truthfulness of your message and confirm your words to those who receive you (see Doctrine and Covenants 100:5–8 ).
The Lord will bless you abundantly as you seek, rely on, and teach by the Holy Ghost (see chapters 4 and 10 ).
