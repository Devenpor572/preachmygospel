Dear Fellow Missionary:
We congratulate you on the great opportunity you have to be a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
There is no more compelling work than this, nor any which brings greater satisfaction.
Preach My Gospel
is intended to help you be a better-prepared, more spiritually mature missionary and a more persuasive teacher.
We urge you to use it daily in your personal and companion preparation, and in your district council and zone conferences.
Study the referenced scriptures and learn the doctrine and principles.
We invite you to rise to a new sense of commitment to assist our Father in Heaven in His glorious work.
Every missionary has an important role in helping “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (
Moses 1:39
).
The Lord will reward and richly bless you as you humbly and prayerfully serve Him.
More happiness awaits you than you have ever experienced as you labor among His children.
The First Presidency
