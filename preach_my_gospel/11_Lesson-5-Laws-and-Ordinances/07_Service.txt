Service
One of the great blessings of membership in the Church is the opportunity to serve.
When we give loving service to others, we are serving God.
When we are baptized, we covenant to give such service (see Mosiah 18:8–10 ).
We are to become aware of others’ physical and spiritual needs.
We then give of our time, talents, and means to help meet those needs.
We follow the example of the Savior, who came to serve others.
We are to do what Jesus did and become like Him.
Soon after baptism new members receive from priesthood leaders the blessing of a responsibility to help in the Church.
This is referred to as a calling.
All of the work in the Church is voluntary.
No one is paid for such service.
When we accept callings, we are sustained publicly in a Church meeting so that other members can acknowledge our calling and provide support.
We are also set apart by a priesthood leader and given special blessings to help us fulfill our callings.
The Church needs the talents and abilities of every member to fill a wide variety of callings.
All callings are important and help build God’s kingdom.
We are to accept such callings and work diligently to learn and fulfill our duties.
As we do so, we grow in faith, develop new talents and a greater ability to serve, and receive numerous other blessings.
Sisters and priesthood holders may be given assignments to minister to others.
As members minister, they determine through communication and inspiration the frequency and type of contact they have with those to whom they give care.
Ministering brothers care for individuals and families in households.
Ministering sisters represent the Relief Society by caring for each adult sister as assigned.
Some opportunities to care for those in need come through Church callings.
Other opportunities are present in members’ homes, neighborhoods, and communities, such as those coordinated by JustServe (where it is approved).
Members can also help the poor and needy of all faiths throughout the world by supporting the Church’s humanitarian efforts, by participating in disaster response, and by giving individual efforts to serve others in need.
