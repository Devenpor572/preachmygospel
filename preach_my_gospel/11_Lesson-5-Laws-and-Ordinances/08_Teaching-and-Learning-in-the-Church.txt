Teaching and Learning in the Church
The Church is organized to perfect and bless the lives of the members.
It gives us opportunities to teach one another the gospel, fellowship and serve one another, and support one another in our quest for salvation.
In the family and through the Church, each member is taught the doctrine of the gospel.
When members are called to teaching assignments, they are provided materials and help to enable them to succeed.
