Priesthood and Organizations
Priesthood is the power and authority given to man to act in God’s name for the salvation of His children.
Priesthood power blesses all of us.
Through the priesthood, women and men receive the ordinances of salvation, as well as the blessings of healing, comfort, and counsel.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is led by Jesus Christ through apostles and prophets.
These are righteous men who are called of God and given the priesthood.
Anciently Christ ordained His Apostles and gave them the priesthood.
That authority was lost when the people rejected the gospel and killed Christ and the Apostles.
Priesthood authority was restored in 1829 when John the Baptist appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery.
He laid his hands on their heads and conferred on them the Aaronic Priesthood (see Doctrine and Covenants 13 ).
A short time later Peter, James, and John of the original Twelve Apostles laid their hands on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and conferred upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood, which Peter, James, and John had received from Jesus Christ (see Doctrine and Covenants 27:12–13 ).
A man can receive priesthood authority only by proper ordination by the laying on of hands by one who has the authority.
A man who receives the priesthood is given a marvelous opportunity.
He enters a covenant to fulfill sacred duties, serve others, and help build up the Church.
He must have a desire to serve God and must be ordained to this power (see Doctrine and Covenants 4:3 ; 63:57 ).
It is also necessary for priesthood holders to perform sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation.
When priesthood authority is used worthily, the power of God is manifest.
Priesthood power can be used only in righteousness, love, and patience.
How does this apply to women?
President Dallin H.
Oaks taught that women who are set apart as missionaries, officers, or teachers in the Church are “given priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function” (“ The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood ,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2014, 51).
All priesthood comes from God.
There are two priesthoods in the Church: the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood.
The Aaronic Priesthood administers ordinances such as baptism and the sacrament.
Worthy males of the appropriate age receive the Aaronic Priesthood soon after baptism and confirmation.
Worthy adult males will eventually receive the Melchizedek, or higher, Priesthood.
Members of the Church receive many spiritual and temporal blessings through the power of this priesthood.
Worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holders can confer the gift of the Holy Ghost, ordain others to the priesthood as assigned, anoint the sick with consecrated oil, and give blessings of healing and comfort.
Worthy husbands and fathers who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood can give their spouses, children, and other family members special blessings.
Ministering brothers care for individuals and families in the households of Church members.
Ministering sisters care for other women in the Church.
Bishops and stake presidents are judges in the Church.
They have the authority to help Saints who have sinned to repent and enjoy the full blessings of Church membership.
They interview people to ensure their worthiness to enter the temple.
In an address to the Relief Society, President Joseph Fielding Smith taught: “While the sisters have not been given the Priesthood, it has not been conferred upon them, that does not mean that the Lord has not given unto them authority.
… A [man] may have authority given to him, or a sister to her, to do certain things in the Church that are binding and absolutely necessary for our salvation, such as the work that our sisters do in the House of the Lord.
They have authority given unto them to do some great and wonderful things, sacred unto the Lord, and binding just as thoroughly as are the blessings that are given by the men who hold the Priesthood” (Joseph Fielding Smith, “Relief Society—an Aid to the Priesthood,” Relief Society Magazine, Jan.
1959, 4).
Church organizations are organized by priesthood authority to assist in strengthening members.
Both men and women are a great resource in missionary work as they assist in finding, teaching, and fellowshipping new converts.
The Relief Society, which includes women ages 18 and over, reaches out in service to families, individuals, and the community.
Young women ages 11 to 18 are members of the Young Women program.
Boys of similar ages participate in the Young Men program.
All children ages 3 to 11 are part of the Primary organization.
All members age 11 and older are enrolled in Sunday School classes.
