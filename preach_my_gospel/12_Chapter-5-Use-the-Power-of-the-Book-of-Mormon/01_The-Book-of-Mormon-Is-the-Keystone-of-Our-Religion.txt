The Book of Mormon Is the Keystone of Our Religion
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Book of Mormon is “the keystone of our religion” ( introduction to the Book of Mormon ).
On another occasion he said: “Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion?
We have none” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 196 ).
An arch is a strong architectural structure made from wedge-shaped pieces that lean against each other.
The middle piece, or keystone, is usually larger than the other wedges and holds them in place.
President Ezra Taft Benson said the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion in at least three ways:
Witness of Christ.
“The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do.
It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity.”
Fulness of doctrine.
“The Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the ‘fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ’ [ Doctrine and Covenants 20:9 ; 27:5 ].
… In the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of [the doctrine] required for our salvation.
And [it is] taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation.”
Foundation of testimony.
“Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.
… If the Book of Mormon be true … one must accept the claims of the Restoration.” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson [2014], 129 , 131 , 128 .)
By gaining a testimony that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, we can know that Joseph Smith was a prophet.
Through him, God’s priesthood authority was restored by heavenly messengers.
God also authorized Joseph to organize the Church of Jesus Christ.
Revelation continues today through living prophets.
