Help People Read and Understand the Book of Mormon
Those who do not read or understand the Book of Mormon will have difficulty receiving a witness that it is true.
You can help them understand the book by reading it with them.
Read during a teaching appointment, during a follow-up visit, or via technology.
You can also arrange for members to read with them.
Watching a Book of Mormon video and then reading the related chapters can be very helpful.
Pray for help as you select passages that address people’s concerns and needs.
Read and discuss short passages, such as 1 Nephi 3:7 or Mosiah 2:17 .
Also read and discuss longer passages or complete chapters, such as 2 Nephi 31 , Alma 7 , or 3 Nephi 18 .
Encourage people to read the Book of Mormon from the beginning, including the testimonies of the Three and Eight Witnesses and the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith .

Take turns reading.
Go at a pace they are comfortable with.

If there is a relevant Book of Mormon video, consider showing it.
