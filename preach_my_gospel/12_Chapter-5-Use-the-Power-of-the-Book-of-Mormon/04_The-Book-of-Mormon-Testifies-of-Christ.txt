The Book of Mormon Testifies of Christ
The central purpose of the Book of Mormon is to testify of Jesus Christ.
It affirms the reality of His life, mission, resurrection, and power.
It teaches true doctrine about Christ and His Atonement.
Several prophets whose writings are preserved in the Book of Mormon saw Christ personally.
The brother of Jared, Nephi, and Jacob saw the premortal Christ.
Multitudes were present during the Savior’s ministry among the Nephites (see 3 Nephi 11–28 ).
Later, Mormon and Moroni saw the resurrected Christ (see Mormon 1:15 ; Ether 12:39 ).
As people read and pray about the Book of Mormon, they will come to know the Savior better and experience His love.
They will grow in their testimony of Him.
They will know how to come unto Him and be saved.
(See 1 Nephi 15:14–15 .)
“The Book of Mormon provides the fullest and most authoritative understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be found anywhere.
It teaches what it really means to be born again.
… We know why we are here on earth.
These and other truths are more powerfully and persuasively taught in the Book of Mormon than in any other book.
The full power of the gospel of Jesus Christ is contained in the Book of Mormon” (Russell M.
Nelson, “ The Book of Mormon: What Would Your Life Be Like without It?
” Ensign or Liahona , Nov.
2017, 62).
