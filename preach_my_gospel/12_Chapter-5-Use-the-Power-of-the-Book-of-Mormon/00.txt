The Book of Mormon, combined with the Spirit, is your most powerful resource in conversion.
This book is an ancient, sacred record written to convince all people that Jesus is the Christ (see the

).
As its subtitle says, the Book of Mormon is “another testament of Jesus Christ.” It is also compelling evidence that God called Joseph Smith as a prophet and restored the gospel of Jesus Christ through him.
