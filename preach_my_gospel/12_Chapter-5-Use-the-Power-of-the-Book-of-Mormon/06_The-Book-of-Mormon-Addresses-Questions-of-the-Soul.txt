“Missionaries must know how to use the Book of Mormon to answer their own questions so they can use it effectively to help others learn to do the same.
… They must internalize the power of the Book of Mormon in teaching the restored gospel, first by applying it in their own lives and then by sharing it with those they teach” (Dallin H.
Oaks, “Counsel for Mission Leaders,” seminar for new mission leaders, June 25, 2022).
