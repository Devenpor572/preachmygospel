The Creation
Under the direction of the Father, Jesus Christ created the earth as a place for us to live and gain experience.
In order to progress and become like God, each of us had to obtain a body and be tested during a time of probation on the earth.
While on the earth we are out of God’s physical presence.
We do not remember our premortal life.
We must walk by faith rather than by sight.
