Our Life on Earth
Life on earth is an opportunity and a blessing.
Our purpose in this life is to have joy and prepare to return to God’s presence.
In mortality we live in a condition where we are subject to both physical and spiritual death.
God has a perfect, glorified, immortal body of flesh and bones.
To become like God and return to His presence, we too must have a perfect, immortal body of flesh and bones.
However, because of the Fall of Adam and Eve, every person on earth has an imperfect, mortal body and will eventually die.
If not for the Savior Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father.
Along with physical death, sin is a major obstacle that keeps us from becoming like our Father in Heaven and returning to His presence.
In our mortal condition we often yield to temptation, break God’s commandments, and sin.
During our life on earth each of us makes mistakes.
Although it sometimes appears otherwise, sin always leads to unhappiness.
Sin causes feelings of guilt and shame.
Because of our sins, we are unable to return to live with Heavenly Father unless we are first forgiven and cleansed.
While we are in mortality, we have experiences that bring us happiness.
We also have experiences that bring us pain and sorrow, some of which is caused by the sinful acts of others.
These experiences provide us opportunities to learn and to grow, to distinguish good from evil, and to make choices.
God influences us to do good; Satan tempts us to commit sin.
As with physical death, we cannot overcome the effects of sin by ourselves.
We are helpless without the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
