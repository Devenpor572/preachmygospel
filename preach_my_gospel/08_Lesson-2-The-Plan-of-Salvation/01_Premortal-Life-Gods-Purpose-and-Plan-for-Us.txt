Premortal Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us
Many people wonder, “Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where are we going?” The plan of salvation gives us the answers to these questions.
God is the Father of our spirits.
We are literally His children, and He loves us.
We lived as spirit children of our Father in Heaven before we were born on this earth.
We were not, however, like our Heavenly Father, nor could we ever become like Him and enjoy all the blessings that He enjoys without the experience of living in mortality with a physical body.
God’s whole purpose—His work and His glory—is to enable each of us to enjoy all His blessings.
He has provided a perfect plan to accomplish His purpose.
We understood and accepted this plan before we came to the earth.
In the scriptures God’s plan is called a merciful plan, the plan of happiness, the plan of redemption, and the plan of salvation.
Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan.
Through His Atonement, Jesus Christ fulfilled His Father’s purpose and made it possible for each of us to enjoy immortality and exaltation.
Satan, or the devil, is an enemy to God’s plan.
Agency, or the ability to choose, is one of God’s greatest gifts to His children.
Our eternal progression depends on how we use this gift.
We must choose whether to follow Jesus Christ or follow Satan.
We are physically separated from God during life on earth, but He wants every one of His children to find peace in this life and a fulness of joy in His presence after this life.
He wants us to become like Him.
