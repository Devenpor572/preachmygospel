Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve
Adam and Eve were the first of God’s children to come to the earth.
God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden.
Adam and Eve were created in God’s image, with bodies of flesh and bones.
While Adam and Eve were in the garden, they were still in God’s presence and could have lived forever.
They lived in innocence, and God provided for their needs.
In the Garden of Eden, God gave Adam and Eve their agency.
He commanded them not to eat the forbidden fruit, or the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
Obeying this commandment meant that they could remain in the garden, but they could not progress by experiencing opposition in mortality.
They could not know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain.
Satan tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and they chose to do so.
This was part of God’s plan.
Because of this choice, they were cast from the garden and out of God’s physical presence.
This event is called the Fall.
Separation from God’s presence is spiritual death.
Adam and Eve became mortal—subject to physical death, or separation of the body and spirit.
They could now experience disease and all types of suffering.
They had moral agency or the ability to choose between good and evil.
This made it possible for them to learn and progress.
It also made it possible for them to make wrong choices and to sin.
In addition, they could now have children, so the rest of God’s spirit children could come to earth, obtain physical bodies, and be tested.
Only in this way could God’s children progress and become like Him.
Teaching about the Fall
When first teaching this doctrine, explain very simply that God chose two of His children, Adam and Eve, to become the first parents on earth.
After their transgression they were subject to both sin and death.
By themselves they could not return to live with Heavenly Father.
The Lord spoke to Adam and taught him the plan of salvation and redemption through the Lord Jesus Christ.
By following that plan, Adam and his family could have joy in this life and return to live with God (see Alma 18:36 ; 22:12–14 ).
