Medium Lesson Plan (10–15 minutes)
Our message helps us understand the purpose of life and who we are.
It gives us hope and helps us find peace, joy, and happiness.
It tells us where we came from, why we are here on earth, and where we will go after this life.
God is our Father, and He loves us.
We are His children.
We are part of His family, and we lived with Him before we were born on this earth.
He has a plan of happiness that makes it possible for us to return to His presence after this life.
Our progress depends on how we use our God-given agency, or ability to choose.
As part of that plan, the Fall of Adam and Eve made it possible for us to come to earth, gain a physical body, have experience, and have families of our own.
But the Fall also brought physical death, which is separation of the spirit from the body, and spiritual death, which is separation from God.
Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan.
Christ’s atoning sacrifice overcame the effects of both physical and spiritual death.
We will all be resurrected and will live forever with physical bodies free of pain and sickness.
Christ also made it possible to overcome spiritual death.
As we live His gospel He will mercifully forgive our sins.
He will heal us and replace guilt and shame with peace and happiness in this life.
As part of God’s merciful plan, we will all suffer a physical death.
Our spirits will be separated from our bodies and will live for a time in the spirit world.
We will then be resurrected with an immortal body, an eternal union of our body and spirit.
We will be judged according to our works and desires.
Those who have lived the gospel will receive our Father in Heaven’s greatest gift, the gift of exaltation—to live as a family in His presence.
Our Heavenly Father has again reached out to His children in love to reveal His plan of happiness.
We learn about this wonderful plan in the Book of Mormon, which you can read, ponder, and pray about.
We invite you to attend church and worship with us.

Full Lesson Plan (30–45 minutes)
Premortal Life: God’s Purpose and Plan for Us
God is our Heavenly Father, and we are His children (see Acts 17:16–34 ; Hebrews 12:9 ).
God has a plan for our happiness.
Jesus Christ is central to that plan.
God’s plan of happiness makes it possible to return to His presence (see Moses 1:39 ).
Our eternal progression depends on how we use our agency (see 2 Nephi 2:27–29 ).
The Creation
Under the Father’s direction, Jesus Christ created the earth (see Hebrews 1:1–3 ).
Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve
Adam and Eve were created in God’s image (see Genesis 1:26–27 ).
In the Garden of Eden they were innocent and lived in God’s presence.
Because they partook of the forbidden fruit, they were cast out of the garden (see Moses 4:19–31 ).
This is called the Fall.
They became mortal, were able to have children, and were also subject to sin and death (see 2 Nephi 2:22–25 ; Moses 5:11 ).
Our Life on Earth
Our purpose in life is to find lasting peace, joy, and happiness as families and to prepare to return to live with God.
We came to the earth to be tested (see Abraham 3:24–25 ).
We gain a body of flesh and bones, but we are subject to physical death.
God gives commandments.
If we obey, we are blessed.
If we disobey, we sin and receive the consequences.
All sin must be paid for, either by ourselves or by Christ (see Doctrine and Covenants 19:15–20 ).
We make choices, and we all commit sin (see Romans 3:23 ).
We have experiences that bring us happiness and also sorrow.
We cannot overcome either physical or spiritual death without Christ.
The Atonement of Jesus Christ
Because Jesus Christ overcame physical death, we will all be resurrected (see Alma 11:41–43 ).
Through Christ’s Atonement we can become clean from sin so that we can return to live in God’s presence (see 2 Nephi 9:8–9 ).
Christ will forgive our sins as we have faith in Him, repent, receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end.
The Spirit World
All people must die.
At death our spirits go to the spirit world.
We live in either a state of misery or a state of peace and rest, depending on how we lived in this life.
The Resurrection, Salvation, and Exaltation
Our spirits and bodies will be reunited in the Resurrection (see Alma 11:42–45 ; 40:23 ).
Eternal life and exaltation are gifts of God given to those who fully obey the gospel of Jesus Christ (see Doctrine and Covenants 14:7 ; 132:17 ).
Judgment and Kingdoms of Glory (see Doctrine and Covenants 76 ; 137 ; 1 Corinthians 15:40–42 )
We will return to God’s presence to be judged according to our works and desires.
If we have repented, we will receive mercy.
We receive a kingdom of glory according to our works and desires (see Doctrine and Covenants 137:9 ).
Those who receive the gospel and live it valiantly throughout their lives will receive the celestial kingdom (see Doctrine and Covenants 76:50–70 ).
Honorable people who are “blinded by the craftiness of men” and who are “not valiant in the testimony of Jesus [Christ]” receive the terrestrial kingdom (see Doctrine and Covenants 76:75, 79 ).
Those who sin and do not repent will receive the telestial glory after they suffer for their sins.

Questions to Ask after You Teach
What questions do you have about what we have taught?
What do you understand about God’s plan for you and your family?
From what we have taught you, what do you understand about the role of Jesus Christ?
What does that mean to you?
Key Definitions
Following are terms that are frequently not understood.
Make sure you explain them clearly and find out if those you are teaching understand.
Atonement of Jesus Christ: As used in the scriptures, to atone is to suffer the penalty for an act of sin, thereby removing the effects of sin from the repentant sinners and allowing them to be reconciled to God.
Jesus Christ suffered in Gethsemane and on the cross.
He was the only one capable of making a perfect Atonement for all mankind.
He suffered the penalty for our sins in Gethsemane and died on the cross.
He took upon Himself the pains, sicknesses, temptations, afflictions, and infirmities of us all (see Alma 7:11–12 ).
Exaltation: To become like our Father in Heaven and live in His presence as members of His family.
President Nelson has taught, “To be exalted—or to gain exaltation—refers to the highest state of happiness and glory in the celestial realm” (“ Salvation and Exaltation ,” 8).
Exaltation comes through the Atonement of Christ and through obedience to all the laws and ordinances of the gospel.
Fall (of Adam and Eve): When Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, they became mortal—that is, subject to sin and death.
Adam became the “first flesh” upon the earth ( Moses 3:7 ).
Latter-day revelation makes clear that the Fall is a blessing and that Adam and Eve should be honored as the first parents of all mankind.
Immortality: The condition of living forever in a resurrected state, not subject to physical death.
Judgment: God, through Jesus Christ, will judge us individually to determine the eternal glory we will receive.
This judgment will be based on our obedience to God’s commandments, including our acceptance of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
We will receive our eternal reward based on whether our works and desires have been good or evil.
Mortality: The time from birth until physical death.
Physical death: Separation of our spirit, which lives forever and cannot die, from our physical body.
Premortal life (premortal existence; pre-earth life): As spirit children of our Father in Heaven, we lived in His presence before we were born on this earth.
In premortal life we did not have physical bodies.
Redemption: To deliver, to purchase, or to ransom, such as to free a person from bondage by payment.
Redemption refers to the Atonement of Jesus Christ and to deliverance from sin.
Jesus’s Atonement redeems all mankind from physical death.
Through His Atonement, those who have faith in Him and repent are also redeemed from spiritual death.
Resurrection: The reuniting of the spirit body with the physical body of flesh and bones after death.
After resurrection, the spirit and body will never again be separated, and the person is immortal.
Every person born on earth will be resurrected because Jesus Christ overcame death.
Salvation: To be saved from physical and spiritual death.
“We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression; … that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel” ( Articles of Faith 1:2–3 ).
All people will be saved from physical death, or resurrected, by the grace of God, through the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.
This is an unconditional gift from the Savior to all human beings, regardless of the choices they make during this life.
Salvation from spiritual death (sin) is conditional.
President Russell M.
Nelson taught, “People may also be saved from individual spiritual death through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, by their faith in Him, by living in obedience to the laws and ordinances of His gospel, and by serving Him” (“ Salvation and Exaltation ,” 8).
Spiritual death: Separation from God and His influences; to die as to things pertaining to righteousness.
Spiritual death was introduced into the world by the Fall of Adam and Eve (see Alma 42:6–7 ).
Mortals with sinful thoughts, words, and works are spiritually dead while still alive on earth (see 2 Nephi 9:39 ).
Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, men and women can become clean from sin and overcome spiritual death as they repent and live the principles and ordinances of the gospel (see Articles of Faith 1:2–3 ).
