The Spirit World
Even though Christ conquered physical death, all people must die, for death is part of the process by which we are transformed from mortality to immortality.
At death our spirits go to the spirit world.
Death does not change our personality or our desires for good or evil.
Those who chose to obey God in this life live in a state of happiness, peace, and rest from troubles and care.
Those who chose not to obey in this life and did not repent live in a state of unhappiness.
In the spirit world the gospel is preached to those who did not obey the gospel or have the opportunity to hear it while on earth.
We remain in the spirit world until we are resurrected.
