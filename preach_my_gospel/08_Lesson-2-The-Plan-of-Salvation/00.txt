Your Purpose
As you teach, help people prepare for baptism and confirmation.
Consider the qualifications for baptism taught in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 and in the related baptismal interview questions.
Prayerfully decide what to teach and which invitations to extend based on the person’s needs, interests, and situation.
Be mindful of the questions and level of understanding of those you teach.
Baptismal Interview Questions
Do you believe that God is our Eternal Father?
Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world?
Are you willing to keep the Sabbath day holy, including partaking of the sacrament weekly and rendering service to others?
Invitations
Will you ask God in prayer to know that what we have taught is true?
Will you repent of your sins?
Will you attend church with us this Sunday?
Will you read the Book of Mormon and ask God in prayer to know that it is the word of God?
Will you follow the example of the Savior and be baptized on (date)?
May we set a time for our next visit?
Commandments from lesson 4 that you choose to include.
Helping Others Learn about Jesus Christ
Missionaries are to testify of Jesus Christ and invite all to come unto Him that they might be saved and receive increased happiness, comfort, joy, and peace in this life.
Providing specific instruction about the Savior is important for those who know little or nothing about Him.
The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is designed to help all people know that “Jesus is the Christ, … manifesting himself unto all nations” ( title page of the Book of Mormon ).
One of the most effective ways to teach and testify of the Savior is to read together from the Book of Mormon.
Passages from other standard works can also be helpful.
Consider the suggestions listed below.
This activity may also be done as part of this or other lessons or as a lesson of its own.
When helpful, repeat this activity several times before and after baptism and confirmation.
