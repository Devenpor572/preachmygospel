Live What You Learn

The study of the [doctrine] of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.”

As you feel the joy that comes from understanding the gospel, you will want to apply what you learn.
Strive to live in harmony with your understanding.
Doing so will strengthen your faith, knowledge, and testimony.
Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding (see John 7:17 ).
As you treasure up the words of the scriptures and latter-day prophets by study and faith, your desire to share the gospel will increase.
You are promised that the Spirit will help you know what to say when you teach.
The Lord said, “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” ( Doctrine and Covenants 84:85 ).
