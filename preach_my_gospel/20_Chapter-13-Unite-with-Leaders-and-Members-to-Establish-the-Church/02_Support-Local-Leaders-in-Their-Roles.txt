Support Local Leaders in Their Roles
Some leadership callings have responsibilities for missionary work.
Understanding these responsibilities helps you support these leaders.
The following descriptions are from chapter 23 in the General Handbook.
Stake president: Holds the priesthood keys in the stake for sharing the gospel and strengthening new and returning members.
He and his counselors give overall direction for these efforts.
Bishopric: Coordinates with the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead the ward’s efforts to share the gospel and strengthen new and returning members.
Elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies: Lead the ward’s day-to-day efforts to share the gospel and strengthen new and returning members.
They work together to lead these efforts with the ward council, under the coordination of the bishop.
See General Handbook , 8.2.3 and 9.2.3 .
Ward mission leader (if called): Coordinates the work of ward members and leaders, ward missionaries, and full-time missionaries.
If a ward mission leader is not called, a member of the elders quorum presidency fills this role.
See General Handbook , 23.5.3 .
Regularly ask yourself, “Am I a blessing to local leaders?” Develop an attitude of “How can I help?”
