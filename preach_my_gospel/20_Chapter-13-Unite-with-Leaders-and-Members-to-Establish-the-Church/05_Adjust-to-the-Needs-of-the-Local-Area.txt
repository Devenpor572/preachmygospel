Adjust to the Needs of the Local Area
Each ward or branch has unique needs for you to adapt to.
You may serve in a small branch or a young single adult ward, or you may serve multiple wards.
Some leaders will have more experience and some less.
Some leaders will have more time available than others.
Look for ways to help local leaders.
They might ask you to help support members in their ministering assignments.
They might ask you to encourage new members to invite their friends to attend church.
You can provide valuable insights about missionary work as leaders and members learn ways to share the gospel.
Where the Church is relatively new, branch leaders might ask you to help new members understand how the Lord has organized His Church.
Your work with leaders may be different in different areas, but all these activities are essential to blessing individuals and establishing the Lordâ€™s Church.
