Support Local Leaders in Strengthening Returning Members
Some members choose to stop participating in the Church.
Local leaders and other members strive to build strong relationships with them and reach out to them.
The Savior said:
“Unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them” ( 3 Nephi 18:32 ).
Local leaders might ask you to help returning members build their faith.
Often these assignments will be with part-member families.
Prayerfully consider how you can invite the Spirit into the homes of returning members as you teach them gospel principles and invite them to act.
Show empathy and compassion for their concerns.
As circumstances allow, teach the gospel to those in the household who have not yet been baptized.
Your love and support can help them deepen their faith in Christ and increase their desire to make and keep covenants.
Coordinate with local leaders when you work with returning members.
These efforts can have a lasting impact on individuals and the local congregation.
