The restored gospel of Jesus Christ helps us answer important questions of the soul.
Through the gospel, we learn about our divine identity and our eternal potential as children of God.
The gospel gives us hope and helps us find peace, happiness, and meaning.
Living the gospel helps us grow and find strength as we face life’s challenges.
God wants the best for His children and desires to give us His greatest blessings, which are immortality and eternal life (see
Moses 1:39
;
Doctrine and Covenants 14:7
).
Because He loves us, He has provided a plan for us to receive these blessings.
In the scriptures, this plan is called the plan of salvation, the great plan of happiness, and the plan of redemption (see
Alma 42:5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 31
).
In God’s plan, each of us makes a journey through premortal life, birth, mortal life, death, and life after death.
God has provided what we need during this journey so that after we die, we can eventually return to His presence and receive a fulness of joy.
Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan.
Through His Atonement and Resurrection, Jesus made it possible for each of us to receive immortality and eternal life.
During our life on earth, we do not remember our premortal life.
Nor do we fully understand life after death.
However, God has revealed many truths about these parts of our eternal journey.
These truths provide sufficient knowledge for us to understand the purpose of life, to experience joy, and to have the hope of good things to come.
This knowledge is a sacred treasure to guide us while we are on earth.
