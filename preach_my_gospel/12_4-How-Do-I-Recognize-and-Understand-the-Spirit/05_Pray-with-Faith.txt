Pray with Faith
You can teach in the Lord’s way only by the power of the Spirit, and you receive the Spirit through the prayer of faith.
The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” ( Doctrine and Covenants 42:14 ).
As you pray for help in your teaching, the power of the Holy Ghost will carry your teachings “unto the hearts of the children of men” ( 2 Nephi 33:1 ).
President Gordon B.
Hinckley illustrated this principle by relating an experience from his mission:
“I always remember two young men who served in my mission.
One was a superstar.
He was educated.
He was bright.
He was quick.
He was a little arrogant.
We had another who was a sign painter.
He came from a sign shop with very little education, but he knew his inadequacies and he relied on the Lord.
When he prayed, you knew he was talking with the Lord.
It wasn’t a rote thing, it was a conversation and that young man accomplished wonders while the other young man went through the motions.
The power that was in the one and the absence of power in the other was so apparent.
Call upon the Lord.
He has extended the invitation, and He will answer” ( Teachings of Gordon B.
Hinckley [1997], 469).
Strive to pray sincerely, with real intent, and with “all the energy of heart” ( Moroni 7:48 ).
Effective prayer requires great effort (see Moroni 10:3–4 ; Doctrine and Covenants 8:10 ; 9:7 ).
Give serious thought to your attitude and to the words you use.
Consider the following when you pray:
Use the language of prayer, which shows that you love and respect your Heavenly Father.
Use proper and respectful language in whatever language you speak.
For example, in English use scriptural pronouns such as Thee, Thou, Thy, and Thine.
Always express gratitude for your blessings.
A conscious effort to be grateful will help you recognize how merciful the Lord has been in your life.
Pray specifically for the guidance and help of the Holy Ghost.
Show that you value this blessing by being sensitive to and aware of spiritual promptings.
Then courageously follow those promptings.
Pray with love and charity.
Pray for people by name.
Ask for inspiration to help you understand and meet their needs.
Pray for the welfare of those you are teaching, new converts, and returning members.
Pray for the members and priesthood and auxiliary leaders in your area.
Pray for your family at home.
Pray for your companion, other missionaries, and your mission president.
Pray to know how you can help others, and then be willing to sacrifice in their behalf.
Pray that you will be shown where to go and what to do.
Pray that you will be led to those who are prepared to receive the message of the Restoration.
Pray that you will recognize them.
Recognize that your Heavenly Father knows what you need better than you do.
Rely on the Spirit to know what to pray for (see 3 Nephi 19:24 ; Doctrine and Covenants 46:28, 30 ).
In your prayers at night, give the Lord an accounting of your day’s activities.
Then review with Him your plan for the next day.
Listen for the promptings of the Spirit.
Pray to overcome temptation.
Yielding to temptation interferes with the Spirit.
Pray and, when appropriate, fast for special blessings.
Pray about and ponder the scriptures.
The scriptures open the window to revelation.
Believe that God will answer your prayers.
Recognize that God’s thoughts are not your thoughts (see Isaiah 55:8–9 ), and trust God to answer your prayers in His own way and in His own time.
“Every morning … , missionaries should get on their knees and plead with the Lord to loosen their tongues and speak through them to the blessing of those they will be teaching.
If they will do this, a new light will come into their lives.
There will be greater enthusiasm for the work.
They will come to know that in a very real sense, they are servants of the Lord speaking in His behalf.
They will find a different response from those they teach.
As they do so by the Spirit, [the people they are teaching] will respond under the influence of the same Spirit.”

Ponder the following statements concerning sincere prayer:
“The trouble with most of our prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceries—we place our order and hang up.
We need to meditate, contemplate, think of what we are praying about and for and then speak to the Lord as one man speaketh to another” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Gordon B.
Hinckley [2016], 114 ).
“If prayer is only a spasmodic cry at the time of crisis, then it is utterly selfish, and we come to think of God as a repairman or a service agency to help us only in our emergencies.
We should remember the Most High day and night—always—not only at times when all other assistance has failed and we desperately need help” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Howard W.
Hunter [2015], 80 ).
Using the following scale, privately evaluate your prayers.
In your study journal, write answers to questions like these: Where would you place yourself on this scale?
Where would you like to be on this scale?
How are you going to change?
