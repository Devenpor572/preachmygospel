Relying on the Spirit
As the Lord’s servant, you are to do His work in His way and by His power.
Some missionaries feel confident that they know how to be successful.
Others lack such confidence.
Remember, however, that your confidence and faith should be in Christ, not in yourself.
Rely on the Spirit rather than your own talents and abilities.
Trust the Spirit to guide you in every aspect of your work.
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the Spirit is basic to teaching and preaching:
“No man can preach the Gospel without the Holy Ghost” (History, 1838–1856, volume B-1 [1 September 1834–2 November 1838], 756, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).
“Some few were called and ordained by the Spirit of revelation and prophecy, and began to preach as the Spirit gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they strengthened by the power of God” (Orson Pratt, A[n] Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions [Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840], 24).
“[Joseph Smith] proceeded to give instruction to the Elders respecting preaching the Gospel, and pressed upon them the necessity of getting the Spirit, so that they might preach with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven” (History, 1838–1856, volume C-1 [2 November 1838–31 July 1842], 969, Church History Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).
During your weekly and daily planning sessions, you will need to ask some basic questions every day—even many times each day (see the “Scripture Study” box that follows for examples of questions).
Seek inspiration to answer these questions in a way that meets each situation.
The answers should then take shape in your plans.
But you should also be willing to follow the Spirit and change your plans when unforeseen opportunities arise.
Study the following scriptures and consider how they answer these important questions that you should ask each day.
Consider what these passages mean for your finding efforts, planning sessions, and personal and companion study.
Also consider their meaning as you teach the lessons, invite people to make commitments, follow up on commitments, strengthen new members and returning members, and work with members.
