The Holy Ghost
The personage of the Holy Ghost .
The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead.
He is a personage of spirit and does not have a body of flesh and bones (see Doctrine and Covenants 130:22 ).
He is the Comforter, who the Savior promised would teach His followers all things and bring to their remembrance all things that He had taught them (see John 14:26 ).
The power of the Holy Ghost.
The witness that comes to sincere seekers of truth before baptism comes through the power of the Holy Ghost.
“The power [of the Holy Ghost] can come upon one before baptism and is the convincing witness that the gospel is true.
By the power of the Holy Ghost a person receives a testimony of Jesus Christ and of His work and the work of His servants upon the earth” (Bible Dictionary, “ Holy Ghost ”).
The Holy Ghost testifies of truth.
All people can know the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon through the power of the Holy Ghost.
“By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things” ( Moroni 10:5 ).
The gift of the Holy Ghost .
People who receive a witness but have not been baptized and confirmed do not yet have the promise of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.
Joseph Smith said: “There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized.
Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him” (“Sabbath Scene in Nauvoo,” Times and Seasons, Apr.
15, 1842, 752).
“The gift of the Holy Ghost comes after one repents and becomes worthy.
… The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ so deeply that no earthly power or authority can separate him from that knowledge.”

“The gift [of the Holy Ghost] can come only after proper and authorized baptism, and is conferred by the laying on of hands.
… The gift of the Holy Ghost is the right to have, whenever one is worthy, the companionship of the Holy Ghost” (Bible Dictionary, “ Holy Ghost ”).
As a member of the Church, you have received the gift of the Holy Ghost by priesthood authority.
This gift entitles you to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost as you remain worthy of it.
Pray for the Spirit’s guidance, and valiantly follow the promptings you receive.
The Holy Spirit of Promise .
The Holy Ghost is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise (see Doctrine and Covenants 88:3 ).
To be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that the Holy Ghost confirms that righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants are acceptable to God.
The Holy Spirit of Promise testifies to the Father that the saving ordinances have been performed properly and that the covenants associated with them have been kept.
Those who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has (see Doctrine and Covenants 76:51–60 ; Ephesians 1:13–14 ).
All covenants and performances must be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise if they are to be valid after this life (see Doctrine and Covenants 132:7, 18–19, 26 ).
Breaking covenants may remove the sealing.
Gifts of the Spirit .
The gifts of the Spirit are special spiritual blessings that the Lord gives to worthy individuals for their own benefit and for their use in blessing others.
For example, missionaries who must learn a new language may receive the gift of tongues to give them divine help in learning a language.
Several gifts of the Spirit are described in Moroni 10:8–18 ; Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–33 ; and 1 Corinthians 12:1–12 .
These are only some examples of the many gifts of the Spirit.
The Lord may bless you in other ways depending on your faithfulness, your needs, and the needs of those you serve.
You should desire spiritual gifts and earnestly seek for them (see Doctrine and Covenants 46:8 ; 1 Corinthians 12:31 ; 14:1, 12 ).
These gifts come by prayer, faith, and works, according to God’s will (see Doctrine and Covenants 63:9–12 ; 84:64–73 ).
