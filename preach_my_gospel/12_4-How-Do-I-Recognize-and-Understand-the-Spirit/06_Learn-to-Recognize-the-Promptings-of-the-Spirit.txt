Learn to Recognize the Promptings of the Spirit
The Spirit is always available to guide and direct you.
However, the Spirit speaks quietly, through your feelings as well as your mind.
One great challenge for you and those you work with is to recognize the quiet, subtle promptings of the Holy Ghost.
President Boyd K.
Packer taught: “The voice of the Spirit is described in the scripture as being neither ‘loud’ nor ‘harsh.’ It is ‘not a voice of thunder, neither … voice of a great tumultuous noise.’ But rather, ‘a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper,’ and it can ‘pierce even to the very soul’ and ‘cause [the heart] to burn.’ ( 3 Ne.
11:3 ; Hel.
5:30 ; Doctrine and Covenants 85:6–7 .) Remember, Elijah found the voice of the Lord was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but was a ‘still small voice.’ ( 1 Kgs.
19:12 .)
“The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand.
Rather it whispers.
It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all.
…
“Occasionally it will press just firmly enough for us to pay heed.
But most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come seeking and listening and say in our manner and expression, like Samuel of ancient times, ‘Speak [Lord], for thy servant heareth.’ ( 1 Sam.
3:10 .)” (“ The Candle of the Lord ,” Ensign, Jan.
1983, 53).
Many voices in the world compete for your attention, and they can easily drown out spiritual impressions if you are not careful.

In answer to the question “How do we recognize the promptings of the Spirit?” President Gordon B.
Hinckley read Moroni 7:13, 16–17 and then said: “That’s the test, when all is said and done.
Does it persuade one to do good, to rise, to stand tall, to do the right thing, to be kind, to be generous?
Then it is of the Spirit of God.
…
“If it invites to do good, it is of God.
If it inviteth to do evil, it is of the devil.
… And if you are doing the right thing and if you are living the right way, you will know in your heart what the Spirit is saying to you.
“You recognize the promptings of the Spirit by the fruits of the Spirit—that which enlighteneth, that which buildeth up, that which is positive and affirmative and uplifting and leads us to better thoughts and better words and better deeds is of the Spirit of God” ( Teachings of Gordon B.
Hinckley, 260–61).
God answers your prayers through personal inspiration and revelation.
Through the Holy Ghost He will guide you in your finding efforts, as you teach the restored gospel, and as you strengthen returning members and new converts.
Your task is to live worthily, pray fervently, and learn to recognize and follow courageously the Spirit’s guidance.
