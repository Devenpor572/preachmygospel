The Light of Christ
A person is capable of receiving spiritual guidance before being baptized and confirmed.
This spiritual influence begins with the Light of Christ, which “is given to every man, that he may know good from evil” ( Moroni 7:16 ; see also verses 14–19 ).
“The light of Christ is just what the words imply: enlightenment, knowledge, and an uplifting, ennobling, persevering influence that comes upon mankind because of Jesus Christ.
…
“The light of Christ should not be confused with the personage of the Holy Ghost, for the light of Christ is not a personage at all.
Its influence is preliminary to and preparatory to one’s receiving the Holy Ghost.
The light of Christ will lead the honest soul who ‘hearkeneth to the voice’ to find the true gospel and the true Church and thereby receive the Holy Ghost” (Bible Dictionary, “ Light of Christ ”; see also Doctrine and Covenants 84:46–47 ).
President Boyd K.
Packer said: “It is important for a … missionary … to know that the Holy Ghost can work through the Light of Christ.
A teacher of gospel truths is not planting something foreign or even new into an adult or a child.
Rather, the missionary or teacher is making contact with the Spirit of Christ already there.
The gospel will have a familiar ‘ring’ to them” (“The Light of Christ” [address given at the seminar for new mission presidents, June 22, 2004], 2, Church History Library, Salt Lake City).
