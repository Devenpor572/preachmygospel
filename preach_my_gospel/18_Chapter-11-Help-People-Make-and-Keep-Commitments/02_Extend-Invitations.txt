Extend Invitations
As a representative of Jesus Christ, you invite people to follow Him and receive the joy of His gospel.
You extend specific invitations for them to do things that will build their faith in Christ.
Then you support them in keeping their commitments.
Invitations and commitments are vital for the following reasons:
They help people live the principles they learn so they feel the confirming witness of the Spirit.
Keeping commitments is one way people demonstrate repentance (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 ).
Repentance helps people experience the peace and joy of God’s forgiveness.
They will also have increased help from God for their challenges.
Keeping commitments prepares people to make and keep sacred covenants.
You can show your love for people and your faith in God’s promises by helping people keep their commitments.
Invite as Led by the Spirit
Seek the guidance of the Spirit about what invitations to extend and when to extend them.
Consider what teaching or doctrine, correctly understood, will help a person accept your invitation.
The right invitation at the right time can prompt people to do things that will build their faith.
These actions can lead to a mighty change of heart (see Mosiah 5:2 ; Alma 5:12–14 ).
The invitations you extend may be small, such as reading a chapter of scripture or coming to sacrament meeting.
Or they may be as pivotal as being baptized.
Invitations should be appropriate for where a person is on his or her spiritual journey.
Spirit-led invitations build on each other to help a person progress spiritually (see 2 Nephi 28:30 ; Doctrine and Covenants 93:12–13 ).
Ask yourself, “What commitments is the person keeping?
What does he or she need to do next to progress?”
Listen to those you are talking with or teaching.
From what you hear and feel, seek the Spirit’s guidance about what invitations will help each person progress toward making sacred covenants.
Principles for Extending Invitations
Extending invitations requires faith in Christ.
Have faith that He will bless people when they accept and follow through on your invitations.
People are more likely to change when you invite them to act on a truth of the gospel and help them see how the change will bless them.
They will change to the degree that they feel the Spirit and experience the joy of living the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Whenever you engage with people, in person or online, consider what invitation could help them strengthen their faith in Christ and feel the Spirit.
Sometimes this may be as simple as meeting with you again or coming to a Church activity.
As you prepare to teach a lesson, consider the needs and progress of each person.
Make sure your lesson plan includes one or more invitations that will help the person progress.
Be careful not to extend too many invitations at once.
A person needs time to act, grow, and learn from each invitation.
Be bold but not overbearing as you invite people to make commitments (see Alma 38:12 ).
Respect people’s agency.

Invite with Kind and Clear Language
An invitation often takes the form of a “will you” question, which requires a yes or no response.
Make your invitations kind, specific, and clear.
They should invite or lead people to make a commitment to act with faith in Jesus Christ.
Although your invitations will be unique for each person, consider the following examples:
Attending church provides a time and place for you to worship God and feel His Spirit.
It can also help you become part of a supportive community as you make changes to come closer to the Savior.
Will you come with us to sacrament meeting this Sunday?
Now that we have discussed the importance of studying the scriptures, will you read [a specific passage of scripture]?
Will you write down any impressions or questions you may have?
We can discuss your thoughts the next time we meet.
We have been discussing the life of the Savior and His commandments.
Will you follow His example by being baptized into His Church and making promises with Him?
(See “ The Invitation to Be Baptized and Confirmed ” in chapter 3.)
You expressed interest in connecting more with God in your life.
Will you pray with faith during the next few days so you can experience the blessings of prayer?
We have a video that we think you will find helpful.
Can we show it to you or send you a link?
Will you watch it?
Can we check with you tomorrow to see what you think?
Seek the promptings of the Holy Ghost as you consider natural ways to extend kind, specific, and clear invitations.
Personal or Companion Study
