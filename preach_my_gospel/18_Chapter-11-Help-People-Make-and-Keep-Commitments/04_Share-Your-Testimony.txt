Share Your Testimony
Share your testimony whenever you extend an invitation and promise blessings.
Tell how you have been blessed as you have lived the principle you are teaching.
Share your testimony that the principle will bless the person’s life as he or she lives it.
Your sincere testimony will help create an environment for people to feel the Holy Ghost confirm truth.
This will encourage them to accept the invitations you will extend.
For more information, see “ Share Your Testimony ” in chapter 10.
