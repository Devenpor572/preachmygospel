Promise People Blessings
God promises to bless us as we keep His commandments (see Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21 ).
People who keep the commandments and remain faithful “are blessed in all things” and will “dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness” ( Mosiah 2:41 ).
As you invite people to make commitments, promise them blessings for keeping their commitments.
You can identify many of these blessings by studying the scriptures, the teachings of latter-day prophets, and the lessons in chapter 3 .
Think also of the blessings in your own life.
Prayerfully decide what blessings to promise each person as you extend invitations.
When inviting a person to live a commandment, teach the following:
Obeying the commandments shows our love for Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ (see John 14:15 ).
Obeying the commandments shows God that we trust Him (see Proverbs 3:5–6 ).
God’s blessings are both spiritual and temporal (see Mosiah 2:41 ).
God’s greatest blessing is eternal life (see Doctrine and Covenants 14:7 ).
As we sincerely pray and act in faith, God will help us accomplish the things He has commanded us to do (see 1 Nephi 3:7 ).
God fulfills His promises to bless us according to His way and timing (see Doctrine and Covenants 88:68 ).
People often face opposition in keeping the commandments.
Support those you teach, and assure them that God will bless them as they strive to do His will.
Help them understand that opposition is an opportunity to grow by choosing to follow Christ even when it is difficult (see 2 Nephi 2:11, 13–16 ).
Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland taught: “Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come ” (“ An High Priest of Good Things to Come ,” Ensign , Nov.
1999, 38).
