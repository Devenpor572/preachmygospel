Accountability
The principle of accountability is fundamental in God’s eternal plan (see Alma 5:15–19 ; Doctrine and Covenants 104:13 ; 137:9 ).
This principle influences how you think and feel about the sacred responsibility the Lord has given you.
Accountability also influences how you approach your work.
During His earthly ministry, the Savior gave assignments to His disciples to help them grow, develop, and accomplish His work.
He also gave them opportunities to account for the work they were given to do (see Luke 9:10 ; 3 Nephi 23:6–13 ).
As a missionary, you likewise account for the work the Lord has given you to do.
Approach your goal setting and planning with the idea that you will account to the Lord through prayer each day.
Also be accountable to yourself and to your mission leaders.
Rendering an account should be a loving, positive experience in which your efforts are recognized and you identify ways you can improve.
