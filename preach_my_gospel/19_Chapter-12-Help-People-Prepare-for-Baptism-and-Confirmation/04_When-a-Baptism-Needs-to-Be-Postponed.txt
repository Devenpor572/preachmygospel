When a Baptism Needs to Be Postponed
Sometimes a baptism needs to be postponed because of challenges with testimony or worthiness.
When this happens, handle the situation sensitively and privately.
Help the person understand how to prepare for baptism at a future date.
Encourage the person and offer hope in Christ and His Atonement.
Ask ward members to provide fellowship.
Continue teaching the basic principles of the gospel until the person is ready to be baptized and confirmed.
Wait until that time to schedule a new baptismal date.
