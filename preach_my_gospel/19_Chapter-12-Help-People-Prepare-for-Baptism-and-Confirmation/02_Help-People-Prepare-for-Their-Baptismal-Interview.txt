Help People Prepare for Their Baptismal Interview
The baptismal interview is an important step to ensure that a person meets the Lord’s qualifications for baptism.
Schedule a baptismal interview only when a person is ready.
Help people prepare for this interview so they feel comfortable about it.
Explain what it will be like.
Tell them that they will meet with another missionary like you.
Explain the purpose of the interview.
It is an opportunity for them to witness that they have “repented of all their sins [and] manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins” ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 ).
Share the questions the interviewer will ask (see below).
This helps the person prepare to answer them.
Make sure the person understands what you have taught and the covenant he or she will make at baptism.
This covenant is to:
Be willing to take upon him or her the name of Jesus Christ.
Keep the commandments of God.
Serve God and others.
Endure to the end.
(See lesson 4 .)
Bear testimony about the great blessings that come from being baptized and confirmed and keeping the baptismal covenant.
These blessings include the remission of sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost.
