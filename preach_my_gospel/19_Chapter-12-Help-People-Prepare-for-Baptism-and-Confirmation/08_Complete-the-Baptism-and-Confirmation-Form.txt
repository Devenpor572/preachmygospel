Complete the Baptism and Confirmation Form
It is vital that a membership record is promptly created after a person is baptized and confirmed.
Concerning such records in his day, Moroni wrote that new members “were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way” ( Moroni 6:4 ).
As you teach someone who is preparing to be baptized, begin to fill out the Baptism and Confirmation Form in the Preach My Gospel app.
Explain that this form will be used to create a membership record.
This record will contain important information about the ordinances the person receives.
When Church members move, their membership record is forwarded to their new ward so local leaders and members can support them.
As soon as the new member is baptized and confirmed, update the form with information about each ordinance, including who performed it.
When you have completed the form, record the information in the Preach My Gospel app and submit it to the ward clerk electronically.
As soon as the clerk has received the form, he reviews it and creates a membership record.
After the membership record is created, a clerk prepares a Baptism and Confirmation Certificate.
This certificate is signed by the bishop and given to the person.
The name and sex on the membership record and certificate should match the person’s birth certificate, civil birth registry, or current legal name.
