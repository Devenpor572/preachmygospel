The Gospel of Jesus Christ
The gospel of Jesus Christ defines both your message and your purpose; that is, it provides both the “what” and the “why” of missionary work.
The Book of Mormon teaches plainly the gospel of Jesus Christ.
According to the Book of Mormon the gospel of Jesus Christ includes (1) faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) repentance through the Atonement of Christ; (3) baptism by immersion in Christ’s name; (4) the gift of the Holy Ghost; and (5) enduring to the end (see 2 Nephi 31 ; 3 Nephi 11 ; and 3 Nephi 27 ).
It also teaches us what we need to believe about Christ if we are to have faith in Him.
For example, when He presented His gospel to the people in the New World, the Savior said: “I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.
And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil” ( 3 Nephi 27:13–14 ).
The Savior added, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do” ( 3 Nephi 27:21 ).
Additionally, the Book of Mormon provides insights to the kind of things we must do if we are to endure to the end, including the endowment and sealing ordinances of the temple, praying, fasting, studying the scriptures, following the example of the Savior, and obtaining Christlike attributes.
In this context, the Book of Mormon teaches that we can become “saints through the atonement of Christ the Lord” ( Mosiah 3:19 ).
“Preach the first principles of the Gospel—preach them over again: you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you.
You can enlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly.
You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those [you] teach.”

A purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to cleanse people of their sins so they can receive His mercy at the day of judgment.
Therefore, the focus of this book and, more important, the work you do each day is to invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
Individuals and families begin to follow Christ as they exercise faith in Him and repent of their sins.
That faith is developed as they follow the Savior’s example by humbling themselves, seeking God’s will, and obeying God’s commandments (see 2 Nephi 31:6–7 ; 3 Nephi 27:13–14 ).
They receive a remission of sins through baptism and by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost from one who has authority from God to perform these ordinances.
They then endure to the end, or, in other words, they continue throughout their lives in exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, and renewing the covenants they have made.
These are not just steps that they experience once in their lives; rather, when repeated throughout life these principles become an increasingly rewarding pattern of living.
In fact, it is the only way of living that will bring peace of conscience and enable Heavenly Father’s children to return to live in His presence.
Obedience to Jesus Christ is a lifelong commitment.
Through exercising faith, repenting, being baptized and committing to serve Christ, and then receiving the Holy Ghost, we can experience healing, forgiveness of sins, and complete conversion to the Savior and His gospel.
The doctrine of Christ can change how people believe and how they live; it also directs how you work and focuses your efforts.
Help people gain faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance by teaching and testifying that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood have been restored and by inviting them to live by His teachings.
