Missionary Work
Following are statements made by some of the Presidents of the Church in this dispensation.
President Joseph Smith (1830–1844)
“After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 330 ).
President George Albert Smith (1945–1951)
“We will attain our exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom only on the condition that we share with our Father’s other children the blessings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and observe the commandments that will enrich our lives here and hereafter” ( Sharing the Gospel with Others, 190).
President David O.
McKay (1951–1970)
“Every member … a missionary!” (in Conference Report, Apr.
1959, 122).
“True Christianity is love in action.
There is no better way to manifest love for God than to show an unselfish love for your fellow men.
This is the spirit of missionary work” ( Gospel Ideals [1954], 129).
President Ezra Taft Benson (1985–1994)
“We are commanded by God to take this gospel to all the world.
That is the cause that must unite us today.
Only the gospel will save the world from the calamity of its own self-destruction.
Only the gospel will unite men of all races and nationalities in peace.
Only the gospel will bring joy, happiness, and salvation to the human family” ( The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson [1988], 167).
President Howard W.
Hunter (1994–1995)
“What does the Atonement [of Jesus Christ] have to do with missionary work?
Any time we experience the blessings of [the Savior’s] Atonement in our lives, we cannot help but have a concern for the welfare of [others].
… A great indicator of one’s personal conversion is the desire to share the gospel with others” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Howard W.
Hunter [2015], 127–28 ).
President Gordon B.
Hinckley (1995–2008)
“We are here to assist our Father in His work and His glory, ‘to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man’ ( Moses 1:39 ).
Your obligation is as serious in your sphere of responsibility as is my obligation in my sphere” ( “This is the Work of the Master ,” Ensign, May 1995, 71).
“Let there be cultivated an awareness in every member’s heart of his own potential for bringing others to a knowledge of the truth.
Let him work at it.
Let him pray with great earnestness about it” (“ Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep ,” Ensign, May 1999, 106).
President Thomas S.
Monson (2008–2018)
“Remember that this work is not yours and mine alone.
It is the Lord’s work, and when we are on the Lord’s errand, we are entitled to the Lord’s help.
Remember that the Lord will shape the back to bear the burden placed upon it” (“ To Learn, to Do, to Be ,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov.
2008, 62).
President Russell M.
Nelson (2018–present)
“The Lord’s message is for everyone.
This is a global work.
… The message is to invite all God’s children on both sides of the veil to come unto their Savior and enjoy the blessings of the temple, have enduring joy, and qualify for eternal life.
And that will bring hope, help, and lift to all people” (“President Nelson Bolsters Faith from London, First Stop on Global Tour,” Church News, Apr.
