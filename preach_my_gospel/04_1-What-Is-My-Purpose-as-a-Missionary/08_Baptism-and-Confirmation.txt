Baptism and Confirmation
Baptizing and confirming the people you teach is central to your purpose.
Baptism is for the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost brings a host of blessings to those who live worthy of it.
Through these ordinances people enter the gate and continue on the path to eternal life and exaltation.
President Dallin H.
Oaks said: “We do not preach and teach in order to ‘bring people into the Church’ or to increase the membership of the Church.
We do not preach and teach just to persuade people to live better lives.
… We invite all to come unto Christ by repentance and baptism and confirmation in order to open the doors of the celestial kingdom to the sons and daughters of God.
No one else can do this” (“The Purpose of Missionary Work,” missionary satellite broadcast, Apr.
1995).
As you teach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, help people understand the sacred nature and need for both baptism by water and by the Spirit and confirmation as members of the Church.
Help them realize that receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is a great blessing in this life and a key to their salvation.
The Holy Ghost will “teach [them] all things” ( John 14:26 ).
President Boyd K.
Packer taught: “When you are teaching [people] and preparing them for baptism by water, you must also think of the gift of the Holy Ghost—baptism by fire.
Think of it as one sentence.
First comes the baptism of water and then the baptism of fire” (“The Gift of the Holy Ghost: What Every Missionary Should Know—and Every Member As Well” [address given at the seminar for new mission presidents, June 2003]).
The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 95 ).
Help those you teach understand that to qualify for baptism, confirmation, and receiving the Holy Ghost, they must meet the conditions given in Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 .
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 Qualifications for Baptism
Humble themselves before God.
Desire to be baptized.
Come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits.
Repent of all their sins.
Are willing to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ.
Have a determination to serve Christ to the end.
Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins.
Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 Qualifications for Baptism

Are willing to take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ.
Have a determination to serve Christ to the end.
Manifest by their works that they have received the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins.
After worthy converts are baptized, they are confirmed members of the Church and the gift of the Holy Ghost is conferred upon them.
This confirmation occurs under the direction of the bishop or branch president in a sacrament meeting soon after the baptism.
While the two ordinances are separated by a brief time, confirmation complements and completes baptism.
