Family History and Temple Ordinances
Family history or genealogy provides another way you can find people to teach.
Family history is now one of the most widespread hobbies in the world.
What we sometimes refer to as the spirit of Elijah is “the distinctive influence of the Holy Ghost [that] draws people to identify, document, and cherish their ancestors and family members—both past and present” (David A.
Bednar, “ The Hearts of the Children Shall Turn ,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov.
2011, 25; see also Russell M.
Nelson, “ A New Harvest Time ,” Ensign, May 1998, 34).
Throughout the world, the Spirit is influencing millions of people to search for their ancestors.
People can often feel the Spirit as they talk about families.
Many want a stronger connection with their extended family.
This can lead to a desire to find a connection and identity as part of God’s family.
Ancestors eager for their ordinances are praying for their posterity on earth to accept your teachings and perform those ordinances vicariously for them in the temple.
Determine what types of family history resources are available in your area.
For example, you might provide a copy of the My Family booklet or introduce the people you are teaching to a temple and family history consultant or other member who can help them learn about FamilySearch.org .
Involve members so that those you are teaching will meet people who can friendship them.
Explain that services on FamilySearch.org are offered free of charge.
For many people, family history is about discovering and capturing family stories and photos and recording the dates of important life events.
You can help those you are teaching record this information on FamilySearch.org or in the My Family booklet.
It is also a good idea to share your own family stories and photos, when appropriate, with those you meet or teach.
As you invite others to share memories of their loved ones, they may feel the Holy Ghost testifying to them about the importance of family in God’s plan.
These moments can lead to natural conversations about the purpose of life, God’s plan of happiness, and the role of the Savior in that plan.
“I hope to see us dissolve the artificial boundary line we so often place between missionary work and temple and genealogical work, because it is the same great redemptive work!”

Kimball
“ The Things of Eternity—Stand We in Jeopardy?
” Ensign, Jan.
1977, 3

To get started, consider doing the following:
Discuss with the bishop and ward council your desire to offer help with family history to those you meet each day.
Discuss with ward leaders how to best coordinate this effort:
Is the bishop comfortable with your offering the help of ward members?
Which ward members serve as temple and family history consultants?
How can you best ask these members for help?
If you have a family history center in your area, become familiar with the members who serve there and the best ways to use the center in your work.
Ensure that you have your own FamilySearch.org account, and become familiar with your own family history.
Offer to help people get started with finding out more about their family history, recording their family stories or memories, and organizing their information and photos using the free resources on FamilySearch.org .
Use the My Family booklet, your own family photos, or FamilySearch.org resources as you find people to teach.
Where possible, teach a family history class in a public place or offer one-on-one consultations.
Read the following account related by a senior missionary.
Note the role family history played in the couple’s conversion.
Mildred Schultz was a devout member of her church.
It was no surprise that when the missionaries knocked on her door, she wasted no time in inviting them in so that she could teach them the “truth.” As the missionaries taught, she was touched by the truths of the restored gospel and was baptized.
Throughout the teaching process, her husband, Frank, chose not to listen.
This is where I come into the picture.
The elders introduced us to Sister Schultz.
We helped her begin her family tree and then invited her to meet us at the family history center.
The day came for our meeting, and Frank asked if he might come along so that he could search for his ancestors as well.
Of course, she was thrilled at the prospect, and they headed off to the center.
The elders had planned to meet us there later during the day.
Before they arrived, we showed Frank and Mildred the library and introduced them to Sister Wright.
Sister Wright was the family history specialist, and she offered to help find information about Frank’s father.
She found his name in a book and was also able to provide Frank with a map of Germany that showed the location of his father’s birth.
He was so excited about these discoveries that when the elders came, he invited them to dinner to show them pictures and share his family history.
The Spirit of Elijah had touched and softened his heart and had opened a door for the gospel to fill his life.
That evening, Mildred pondered what she might say to help Frank become more interested in the gospel.
A question came into her mind.
“Frank,” she started, “do you want to be with me forever, even after this life is over?
Do you want to have an eternal family?” He quickly said, “Oh, Mildred, of course I do.
How can I do it?” This question is what she had been praying for.
“Listen to what the missionaries have to say,” she responded.
He agreed.
As the elders taught, the warmth of the message of the Restoration melted away his doubts and fears.
He readily accepted the truths the missionaries shared.
He accepted the invitation to be baptized.
Frank and Mildred have been strong and active in the Church ever since.
Frank and Mildred worked hard to complete the work so that the saving ordinances could be performed for their family.
It was an exciting day when they were baptized in behalf of their family members.
In the process of getting the temple work done, Brother Schultz had a dream about his father.
He saw his father at the ranch that served as his childhood home.
His father was standing beside his porch rocker, dressed in white and holding his arms out to his son.
Frank awoke from the dream crying.
He knew that his father had accepted the work they had done.

Family history is a powerful resource to use in finding those whom the Lord is preparing to receive the restored gospel.
Pray to be aware of opportunities to use family history in your finding efforts.
People typically have spiritual feelings as they talk about families.
People also feel the Spirit as they are taught about the doctrine concerning why we do family history work.
In addition, convert retention is enhanced as new members are able to search their family roots and perform sacred ordinances in behalf of their ancestors.
