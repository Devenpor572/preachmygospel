Developing the Faith to Find
The doctrine and principles in this chapter will strengthen your faith that the Lord is preparing people to receive you and the restored gospel.
He will lead you to them or He will lead them to you.
Finding is different in different parts of the world.
Missionaries and mission presidents need to adapt to circumstances.
Despite differences, however, the principles for finding are universal.
The Family of God.
All people on the earth were members of God’s family in the premortal life (see Acts 17:26–29 ; Hebrews 12:9 ).
We are part of God’s family in this life and can enjoy even greater blessings as members of His family in the life to come.
We are all brothers and sisters in the family of God.
This knowledge gives us a sense of identity and belonging.
It gives us reason to hope for eternal life in God’s presence.
We understand these basic truths because of the Restoration.
Teaching restored truths to your brothers and sisters is your responsibility and blessing.
Like Alma seeking to help the apostate Zoramites, you can pray: “O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ.
Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious … ; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee” ( Alma 31:34–35 ).
“Find Them That Will Receive You.” You are to build up the Church by finding “them that will receive you” ( Doctrine and Covenants 42:8 ).
Such people will recognize that you are the Lord’s servants.
They will be willing to act on your message.
Many of these people have been “kept from the truth [only] because they know not where to find it” ( Doctrine and Covenants 123:12 ).
Usually you do not know who these people are.
They may not immediately recognize that you are the Lord’s servants.
They may not understand that greater peace, direction, and purpose in life will come through the restored gospel than from anything else.
They often do not realize that they are looking for the restored gospel until they have found it.
For example, one convert said, “When I heard the gospel, it filled a hole in my heart that I didn’t know was there.” Another said, “I have finished the search I didn’t know I was on.”
Wherever you are assigned to serve, remember that the Lord has “suffered you to come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in [Him] for the salvation of souls.” Work effectively to “lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that [the Lord] shall put in your hearts.” If you do, you will receive the promise that “you shall not be confounded before men,” and “it shall be given you … in the very moment, what ye shall say” ( Doctrine and Covenants 100:4–6 ).
Finding by the Spirit is as important as teaching by the Spirit.
As in teaching, your efforts in finding will be effective if you are guided by the Spirit.
Have faith that you will know what to teach and what to do to find those who will receive you.
Activity: Companion Study
Many of the members you visit may be converts to the Church.
Ask them how they came in contact with the Church and how they came to recognize that the missionaries were teaching them the truth.
Summarize their experiences in your study journal.
