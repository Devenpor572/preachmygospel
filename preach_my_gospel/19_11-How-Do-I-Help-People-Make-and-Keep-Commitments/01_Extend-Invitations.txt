Extend Invitations
As a missionary, you desire the salvation of souls (see Mosiah 28:3 ).
You know that people can come unto Christ and be saved only on conditions of repentance (see Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–16 ).
One way to fulfill your desires is to cry repentance (see Alma 5:49 ; Doctrine and Covenants 15:6 ; 16:6 ) and boldly invite people to exercise faith unto repentance, to be baptized by water and the Spirit, and to endure faithfully to the end (see 3 Nephi 27:16–20 ; Mormon 7:10 ).
Commitment is an essential part of repentance.
It is the act of obligating oneself to a course of action and then diligently following through on that decision.
When people are genuinely committed, they have real intent, meaning that they fully intend to do what they have committed to do.
They make an unwavering and earnest decision to change.
They become devoted to Christ and dedicate themselves to His gospel.
Keeping their commitment is how they “truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins” ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 ).
When you ask for commitments as part of your teaching, you are inviting people to repent.
Commitment is also an essential part of making and keeping covenants.
Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland taught: “When you teach [people] to keep their commitments, you are teaching them to become covenant-keepers” (“Making and Keeping Covenants,” missionary satellite broadcast, April 25, 1997).
People who keep commitments before baptism are more likely to make and keep covenants after baptism.
Making and keeping covenants is an essential part of the gospel of Jesus Christ and God’s plan for His children.
One of the best ways to help people make and keep commitments is to extend an invitation.
Extending and following up on invitations is vital because:

People become converted as they live the principles they learn (see John 7:17 ) and feel the Spirit confirm that what they are doing is pleasing to their Father in Heaven.
Repentance and change will help people conquer challenges, rid themselves of shame and guilt, and experience the peace and joy of God’s forgiveness.
Keeping commitments prepares people to make and keep sacred covenants.
You can show your love for the people and your faith in God’s promises by following up to help them repent and keep their commitments.
The commitments required for baptism are listed in the first four lessons.
The commitments related to spiritual progress after baptism and confirmation are listed in lesson 5 .
Be constantly aware of the need to invite people to do things that will strengthen their faith in Christ.
Remember the following principles:
Every finding opportunity—with members, referrals, or personal contacting—should lead to an invitation to act, usually to learn more about the message of the Restoration.
Rarely, if ever, should you talk to people or teach them without extending an invitation to do something that will strengthen their faith in Christ.
Focus on one or more invitations when you teach.
If you do not invite people to make commitments, you are not asking them to repent and come to Christ.
As you prepare in companion study to teach a lesson, consider the needs and progress of each person and include one or more invitations in your lesson plan.
During a lesson you may be inspired to extend invitations other than those you planned.
Always invite people to repent.
Be bold and confident as you invite people to make commitments (see Alma 38:12 ).
Boldness shows your faith that obedience to the Lord’s commandments brings blessings.
People will not likely change unless they are invited to do so.
