Ask Direct Questions
An invitation often takes the form of a “will you” question, which requires a yes or no response.
Invitations should be specific, direct, and clear.
They invite or lead people to decide on a course of action.
They require them to make a commitment and to exercise active faith in the principles you have taught them.
Following are some examples of good invitations, followed by the beginning of a promise and testimony:
