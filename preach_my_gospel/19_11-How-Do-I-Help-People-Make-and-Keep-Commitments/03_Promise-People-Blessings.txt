Promise People Blessings
People need a reason to change their thoughts and actions.
Promised blessings often provide powerful motivation to obey God.
When the Lord gives a commandment, He often promises blessings for keeping that commandment (see Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21 ).
As you prepare people to obey a specific commandment, teach them that:
Living the commandments shows love for God and His Son.
They demonstrate their trust in God as they obey His commandments.
In return, they will receive blessings that He has promised, including the greatest of all blessings, that of eternal life and exaltation for those who keep all His commandments.
As you testify of a commandment, talk about the blessings you have received from living that commandment.
Promise those whom you teach that they can enjoy similar blessings.
As people strive to keep a commitment, ask them to talk about the blessings that Heavenly Father has given them.
Assure them that even though difficulties will enter their lives, His blessings will continue as they obey His will.
