Avoid Ineffective or Excessive Questions
Try not to ask questions that:
Have obvious answers.
Might embarrass someone if he or she does not know the answer.
Include more than one idea.
Pertain to doctrine you have not yet taught.
Do not have a clear purpose.
Are excessive.
Are prying or could irritate and offend people.
Following are examples of less-effective questions:
Who was the first prophet?
(The person might not know the answer.)
How will keeping our bodies pure help us have the Spirit and show that we are willing to follow a prophet of God?
(There is more than one idea.)
Is it important to know about God’s commandments?
(This is a yes-no question, and the answer is obvious.)
What is something we can do every day that will help us feel close to God?
(This is a vague question looking for a specific answer: pray.)
Who was the next prophet after Noah?
(The person might not know the answer, and the question is not important for your message.)
Do you understand what I am saying?
(The person might feel like you are talking down to him or her.)
