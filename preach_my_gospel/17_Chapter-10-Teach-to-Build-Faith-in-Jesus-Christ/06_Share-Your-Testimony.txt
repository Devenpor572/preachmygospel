Share Your Testimony
A testimony is a spiritual witness given by the Holy Ghost.
To share your testimony is to give a simple, direct declaration of knowledge or belief about a gospel truth.
Sharing your testimony adds your personal witness to the truths you have taught from the scriptures.
Sharing your testimony is a powerful way to invite the Spirit and help others feel His influence.
One of the missions of the Holy Ghost is to testify of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
He often fulfills this in companionship with you as you bear testimony.
A powerful testimony does not depend on eloquence or the volume of your voice—but on the conviction and sincerity of your heart.
Be careful not to rush or dramatize your testimony.
Give people a chance to feel the Holy Ghost bear witness to them that what you have taught is true.
Your testimony may be as simple as “Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer” or “I have learned for myself that the Book of Mormon is true.” You could also share a brief experience about how you gained this testimony.
When you teach, share your testimony as you feel prompted, not just at the end.
When your companion is teaching, share your testimony to provide a second witness of what he or she has taught.
Share your testimony that the principle you are teaching will bless the person’s life if he or she will follow it.
Tell how living the principle has blessed your life.
Your sincere testimony will help create an environment for people to feel the Holy Ghost confirm truth.
