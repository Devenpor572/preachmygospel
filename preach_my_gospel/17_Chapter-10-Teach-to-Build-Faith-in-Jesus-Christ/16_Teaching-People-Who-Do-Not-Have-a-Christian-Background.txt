Teaching People Who Do Not Have a Christian Background
Some of the people you teach may not have a Christian background or may not believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
However, many of these people have beliefs, practices, and places they hold sacred.
It is essential that you show respect for their religious beliefs and traditions.
Help Them Understand Who God Is
You may wonder how you should adjust your teaching for people who do not have a Christian background.
The principles that help a person build faith are the same in all cultures.
Help people gain a correct understanding of God and the divine mission of Jesus Christ.
The best way for them to learn these truths is by having personal spiritual experiences.
Some ways you can help them have these experiences are outlined below:
Teach that God is our Heavenly Father, and He loves us.
We are His children.
Invite them to seek that witness for themselves.
Teach about the plan of salvation.
Teach that God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith.
Bear sincere testimony of the gospel, including how you feel Heavenly Father’s love and why you choose to follow Jesus Christ.
Invite them to offer simple, heartfelt prayers—with you and on their own.
Invite them to read the Book of Mormon daily—with you and on their own.
Invite them to attend church.
Introduce them to members of the Church who can explain how they came to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
Invite them to keep the commandments.
Most people desire to have a greater connection with God and to find purpose and meaning in life.
Help them see how they are children of a loving Father in Heaven and how He has a plan for them.
For example, you might begin by saying something like the following:
God is our Father in Heaven, and He loves us.
We are His children.
We lived with Him before we were born.
Because we are all His children, we are all brothers and sisters.
He desires us to return to Him.
Because of His love for us, He has provided a way for us to return to Him through His Son, Jesus Christ.
Adapt Your Teaching as Needed
Many converts from non-Christian backgrounds say that they did not understand much of what the missionaries were teaching.
However, they felt the Spirit and wanted to do what the missionaries asked.
Do all you can to help people understand the doctrine of the gospel.
Be patient and supportive.
It may take time for people to learn to identify and express their feelings.
You may need to adjust the pace and depth of your teaching to help them.
The following suggestions may help as you prepare to teach people who do not have a Christian background:
Understand what spiritual need or interest prompts them to meet with you.
Provide simple overviews and reviews for each lesson.
Ask them to tell you what they understand and what they have experienced.
Define essential words and principles.
People may not be familiar with many of the words you use as you teach.
Return to a previously taught lesson to teach the doctrine more clearly.
This may be necessary any time during the teaching process.
Identify invitations that you could extend to help people experience the blessings of the gospel.
Listed below are some resources in Gospel Library that you might use to help those without a Christian background:
“ Who Is God?
”
“ Who Is Jesus Christ?
”
“ Jesus Christ, Son of God ”
“ What to Expect When Visiting with Missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ”
“ Muslims and Latter-day Saints: Beliefs, Values, and Lifestyles ”
Personal or Companion Study
If possible, identify a convert who did not have a Christian background before meeting with the missionaries.
Arrange to meet and ask about his or her conversion experience.
For example, you might ask the person about:
What led him or her to believe in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
What the experience of praying for the first time was like.
What it was like the first time he or she felt an answer to prayer.
The role of the scriptures in his or her conversion.
What it was like to attend church.
Write what you learn in your study journal.
Consider inviting the person to help you teach someone who does not have a Christian background.
