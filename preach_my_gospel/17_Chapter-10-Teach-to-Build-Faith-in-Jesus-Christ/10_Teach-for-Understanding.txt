Teach for Understanding
Teach the gospel of Jesus Christ so people will understand it.
Study the scriptures and the lessons so you can teach clearly from them.
The more clearly you teach, the better the opportunity for the Holy Ghost to testify of truth.
Ask questions to help people think about what you have taught.
Then listen to see if they understand and accept it.
Part of teaching for understanding is to explain words, phrases, and ideas.
You can improve your ability to teach the gospel by:
Understanding the words you use.
Defining words that others may not understand.
Asking people questions like “Would you share with us your understanding of what we just explained?” or “Would you be willing to summarize what we talked about?”
As you teach the doctrine in chapter 3 , note any words, phrases, and ideas that people might not understand.
Define these by using the resources in the Gospel Library, such as the Guide to the Scriptures , the Bible Dictionary , and Gospel Topics .
Keep your teaching simple and brief.
Keep it focused on the gospel of Jesus Christ, building understanding of basic doctrine and principles.
Help people seek the understanding that comes from the Holy Ghost.
As they gain this understanding, they will come to believe the message of the gospel.
