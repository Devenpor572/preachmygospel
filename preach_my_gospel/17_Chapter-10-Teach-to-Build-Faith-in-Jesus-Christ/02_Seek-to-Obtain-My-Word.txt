“Seek to Obtain My Word”
To teach the gospel of Jesus Christ, you need to know its basic doctrine and principles.
You also need spiritual knowledge and confirmation of gospel truths.
The Lord said, “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word.”
To “obtain” the Lord’s word means to study it and let it sink deep in your heart.
As you make this effort, He promised, “Then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” ( Doctrine and Covenants 11:21 ).
The Lord also said to “treasure up in your minds continually the words of life” ( Doctrine and Covenants 84:85 ).
Treasuring up the Lord’s words will increase your knowledge and strengthen your testimony.
Your desire and ability to teach the gospel will likewise increase.
(See Jacob 4:6–7 ; Alma 32:27–42 ; 36:26 ; 37:8–9 .)
Prayerfully obtain and treasure up the Lord’s word by studying the scriptures, the words of living prophets, and the lessons in chapter 3 .
