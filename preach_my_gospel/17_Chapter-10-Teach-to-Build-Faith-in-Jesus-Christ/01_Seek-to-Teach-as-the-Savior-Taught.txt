Seek to Teach as the Savior Taught
During His earthly ministry, Jesus “went about … teaching … , preaching … , and healing” ( Matthew 4:23 ).
He taught in many settings—in synagogues, in homes, and on the road.
He taught in large gatherings and in private conversations.
Some of His most powerful interactions were very brief or in unusual settings.
He taught through His actions as well as His words.
The Savior taught each person according to his or her unique needs.
For example, when serving a paralyzed man, He forgave his sins and healed him (see Mark 2:1–12 ).
When ministering to a woman who had committed adultery, He protected her and invited her to sin no more (see John 8:2–11 ).
When speaking with a rich man who desired eternal life, He “loved him” despite the young man’s refusal to accept His invitation to follow Him ( Mark 10:21 ; see verses 17–21 ).
You can improve your teaching by learning how the Savior taught.
For example, He loved the Father and those He taught.
He was prayerful.
He taught from the scriptures.
He prepared spiritually.
He asked inspired questions.
He invited people to act in faith.
He likened gospel principles to everyday life.
Seeking to teach as the Savior taught is a lifelong pursuit.
It will come to you line upon line as you follow Him (see 2 Nephi 28:30 ; Ether 12:41 ).
