What You Might Teach People in 3–10 Minutes
God sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to redeem us from sin and death.
Faith in Jesus Christ is a principle of action and power.
Faith helps us experience the Savior’s strengthening power in our lives.
Faith in Jesus Christ leads us to repent.
Repentance is the process of turning to God and turning away from sin.
As we repent, our actions, desires, and thoughts change to be more in harmony with God’s will.
When we repent, God forgives us.
Forgiveness is possible because Jesus Christ atoned for our sins.
Baptism has two parts: baptism by water and by the Spirit.
When we are baptized and confirmed, we are cleansed of our sins, giving us a new start in life.
After we are baptized by water, we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost through the ordinance of confirmation.
As we faithfully follow the gospel path to the end of our lives, God promises that we will have eternal life.
