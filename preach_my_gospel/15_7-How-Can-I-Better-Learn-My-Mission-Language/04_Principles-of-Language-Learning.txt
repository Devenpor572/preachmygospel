Principles of Language Learning
This section describes principles to help you study and learn the language more effectively.
Take responsibility.
Regularly create or adjust your language learning goals and study plan.
Strive to use the language at every opportunity.
Make your study meaningful.
Ask yourself: Why am I studying this?
How will it help me communicate better?
Relate what you study to real-life situations and daily activities.
Study parts of the language that will help you say what you want to say.
For example, if there is a scripture story you would like to include in your teaching, learn the vocabulary and grammar necessary to relate it.
Seek to communicate.
Seek to find an appropriate balance between studying grammar and the structure of the language and learning through your daily activities.
There is no substitute for talking with native speakers of the language.
Learn new concepts thoroughly.
You will be able to recall and effectively use language principles if you review regularly what you have studied and if you practice it again in new situations.
