Learn English
If you do not speak English, you should study it as a missionary.
This will bless you during your mission and throughout your life.
Learning English will enable you to help build the Lord’s kingdom in additional ways and will be a blessing for you and your family.
Many of the suggestions found in this chapter will help you.
Focus particularly on the following:
Set a goal to speak English with your companion.
If your companion already knows English and is trying to learn your language, you might choose to speak English in the apartment and the mission language when you go out.
With your companion, read from the Book of Mormon in English.
You might also choose to alternate: You read a verse in English, and then your companion reads a verse in the mission language.
Correct each other’s pronunciation and intonation.
Ask your mission president for suggestions on a simple English grammar text if you do not already have one.
