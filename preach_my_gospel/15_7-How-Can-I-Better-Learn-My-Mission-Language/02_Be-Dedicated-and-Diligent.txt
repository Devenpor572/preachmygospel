Be Dedicated and Diligent
Learning to teach effectively in your mission language requires diligent effort and the gifts of the Spirit.
Do not be surprised if the task seems hard at first.
Learning a language takes time.
Be patient with yourself.
Listen carefully, speak the language often, learn new vocabulary, and practice grammar and pronunciation every day.
Seek the help of your companion, members, those you teach, and other missionaries.
Do not stop improving your language skills once people begin to understand you.
As your ability to speak the language grows, people will listen more to what you say than to how you say it.
You will be less worried about how to communicate the feelings that are in your heart.
You will be better able to respond to the needs of those you teach and the promptings of the Spirit.
Strive to master the language throughout your mission and after you return.
The Lord has invested much in you, and He may have uses for your language abilities later in your life.
Elder Jeffrey R.
Holland explained: “We would … hope that every missionary learning a new … language would master it in every way possible.
… And as you do so, your [teaching] and testifying skills will improve.
You will be better received by and more spiritually impressive to [the people you teach].
… Don’t be satisfied with what we call a missionary vocabulary only.
Stretch yourself in the language, and you will gain greater access to the hearts of the people” (missionary satellite broadcast, Aug.
1998).
You are not alone in learning your mission language.
Whenever the Lord gives a commandment, He provides a way to accomplish it (see 1 Nephi 3:7 ).
Seek His help.
Be dedicated in your study.
In time you will acquire the language skills necessary to fulfill your purpose as a missionary.
