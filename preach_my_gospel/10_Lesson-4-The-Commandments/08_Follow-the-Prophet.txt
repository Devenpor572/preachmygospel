Follow the Prophet
Truth is a knowledge of things as they really are, were, and will be.
It does not change with conditions or time.
Truth is the same in every age and culture.
God is the source of all truth.
We can have faith in Him because we know He will teach us only truth.
God wants all His children to know the truth.
Therefore, He reveals the truths necessary for salvation through prophets and apostles.
He reveals truth to us personally through the scriptures and personal revelation.
A prophet is called and chosen by God and is a righteous man with great faith.
The Lord reveals truth to him through the Holy Ghost.
He commands His prophet to teach truth to all people.
Those who believe God’s words as revealed through His prophet are blessed.
Christ’s Church is built on the foundation of apostles and prophets, who direct the Church by revelation.
The Lord called Joseph Smith as the first prophet and head of this last dispensation.
His successors who lead The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today are also prophets and apostles.
The President of the Church today is a living prophet.
We are to have faith in God’s chosen prophet, gain conviction of his divine calling, and follow his teachings.
We have frequent opportunities to sustain Church leaders publicly.
To sustain means to offer our support with thoughts, words, and actions.
We are to prepare ourselves so that when the prophets and apostles speak, the Holy Ghost can confirm the truths they teach, and we can then determine to follow the counsel they give us.
Those who listen to and follow the counsel of living prophets and apostles will not go astray.
The teachings of living prophets provide an anchor of eternal truth in a world of shifting values and help us avoid misery and sorrow.
The confusion and strife of the world will not overwhelm us, and we can enjoy the assurance of being in harmony with God’s will.
