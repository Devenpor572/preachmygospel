Keep the Law of Tithing
One of the great blessings of membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the privilege of contributing to the growth of the kingdom of God through paying tithing.
Tithing is an ancient, divine law.
For example, the Old Testament prophet Abraham paid tithes of all he possessed (see Alma 13:15 ).
To those who pay tithing, the Lord promises that He will “open … the windows of heaven, and pour … out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it” ( Malachi 3:10 ).
These blessings may be temporal or spiritual, but they will come to those who obey this divine law.
Tithing means one-tenth, and the Lord has commanded us to give a tenth of our increase, which is understood to mean income, that we may be blessed.
The law of tithing gives us the opportunity to help build His kingdom.
Our tithes are holy to the Lord, and we honor Him by paying tithing.
God promises to abundantly bless those who pay an honest tithe.
Those who do not pay tithing rob God (see Malachi 3:8 ).
They keep for themselves something that rightfully belongs to Him.
We should seek first the kingdom of God, and tithing is an important way of doing that.
Paying tithing is an expression of our faith.
It is an outward sign of our belief in God and His work.
Tithing funds are used to support the ongoing activities of the Church, such as building and maintaining temples and meetinghouses, carrying the gospel to all the world, conducting temple and family history service, and many other worldwide activities.
Tithing does not pay local Church leaders, who serve voluntarily without receiving payment of any kind.
Local Church leaders send the tithing received each week directly to Church headquarters.
A council comprised of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric determines specific ways to use the sacred tithing funds.
