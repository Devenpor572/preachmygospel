Keep the Sabbath Day Holy
Keeping the Sabbath day holy is a commandment.
God declared, “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” ( Exodus 20:8 ).
Our Sabbath-day behavior is a reflection of our commitment to honor and worship God.
By keeping the Sabbath day holy, we show God our willingness to keep our covenants.
Each Sabbath day we go to church to worship Him.
While at church, members of the Church partake of the sacrament to remember Jesus Christ and His Atonement.
Partaking of the sacrament allows us to renew our covenants and show that we are willing to repent of our sins and mistakes.
On the Sabbath day, we enjoy a rest from our labors.
As we attend Church services and worship together, we strengthen each other.
We are renewed by our association with friends and family.
Our faith is strengthened as we study the scriptures and learn more about the restored gospel.
When a community or nation grows careless in its Sabbath activities, its religious life decays and all aspects of life are negatively affected.
The blessings associated with keeping the Sabbath day holy are withheld.
We should refrain from shopping on the Sabbath and participating in other commercial and sporting activities that make the Sabbath feel common.
Instead, we should set this holy day apart from activities of the world by entering into a spirit of worship, thanksgiving, service, and activities with family and friends that are appropriate to the Sabbath.
As Church members endeavor to make their Sabbath activities compatible with the intent and Spirit of the Lord, their lives will be filled with joy and peace.
When we keep the Sabbath day holy, it becomes “a delight” (see Isaiah 58:13–14 ), a time of spiritual refreshment (see Exodus 31:17 ), and a sign of our love for and devotion to our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer.
