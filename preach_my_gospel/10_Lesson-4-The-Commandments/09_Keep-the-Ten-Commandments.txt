Keep the Ten Commandments
Heavenly Father gives us commandments so that we will know what to do and what to avoid in order to receive the blessings He wants to give us (such as joy, peace of conscience, and lasting happiness).
God revealed to Moses the Ten Commandments to guide His people:
“Thou shalt have no other gods before me” ( Exodus 20:3 ).
Other “gods” can include possessions, power, or prominence.
“Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” ( Exodus 20:4 ).
“Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain” ( Exodus 20:7 ).
“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” ( Exodus 20:8 ).
“Honour thy father and thy mother” ( Exodus 20:12 ).
“Thou shalt not kill” ( Exodus 20:13 ).
“Thou shalt not commit adultery” ( Exodus 20:14 ).
“Thou shalt not steal” ( Exodus 20:15 ).
“Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” ( Exodus 20:16 ).
“Thou shalt not covet” ( Exodus 20:17 ).
The Ten Commandments are still valid today.
They teach us to worship and show reverence for God.
They also teach us how to treat one another.
No Other Gods
People in many cultures own or pay respect to objects that remind them of Deity or ancestors.
Sometimes those objects, such as statues, religious emblems, or small shrines, might also be the focus of their worship.
Help those you teach understand that the Lord has commanded us not to worship idols.
Encourage them to remove from their home any object they worship or to which they pray.
Help them focus their faith and worship on their Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
Teach them that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ focuses on the living Christ.
In the restored gospel the Lord has taught us how to remember Him.
We remember Him through prayer, fasting, attending church, partaking of the sacrament, and attending the temple.
