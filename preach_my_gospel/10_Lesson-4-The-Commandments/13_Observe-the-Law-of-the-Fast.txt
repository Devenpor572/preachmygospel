Observe the Law of the Fast
Great blessings are available to those who obey God’s commandment to fast.
Fasting means going without food and drink for a period of time.
Usually the first Sunday of each month is set aside as a special day to fast for two consecutive meals, pray, and bear testimony.
Fasting and prayer go together.
When we fast and pray with faith, we are more receptive to receiving answers to our prayers and blessings from the Lord.
He promises us that He will guide us continually.
We should fast and pray for specific purposes.
Fasting is private and spiritual, and we should not draw attention to the fact that we are fasting.
Pure religion includes caring for the poor.
We are to help them meet their physical and spiritual needs.
When we fast, we donate money to the Church for the care of the poor and the needy.
We call this a fast offering.
We give at least the amount of money we save by fasting for two meals.
However, we need not limit our contribution to the cost of two meals.
We are encouraged to be as generous as our means allow.
By caring for the poor, we help fulfill our baptismal covenant and retain a remission of our sins.

How to Donate Tithes and Offerings
Tithes and offerings are paid voluntarily and privately.
Members are encouraged to pay tithes as they receive their income.
However, members who wish to pay annually may do so.
Members may contribute fast-offering funds directly to a member of the bishopric or to an Aaronic Priesthood holder designated to receive fast-offering donations.
Members make donations by completing a donation slip, which is obtained from the bishopric.
(Tithing donations, as opposed to fast offerings, should be given only to a member of the bishopric.) The member keeps the yellow copy and seals the white copy and the donation in an envelope that is provided.
The envelope is given to a member of the bishopric.
Members may also make donations online using their private Church account.
These donations are considered sacred and belong to the Lord.
A member of the bishopric and a clerk keep a careful, confidential accounting of all donations.
Members attend tithing settlement with the bishop at the end of each year to declare their tithing faithfulness.
At this private meeting, members receive a year-end report of all their donations.
All financial information is kept strictly confidential.
