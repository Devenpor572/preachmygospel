Study the Scriptures
The scriptures are written records of God’s dealings with His children as recorded by prophets under the guidance of the Holy Ghost.
We show our faith by studying, believing, and obeying God’s revealed word.
We diligently search the scriptures to understand the truth.
We feast upon them because they open the door to revelation and show us what we need to do and become.
We search the scriptures to learn about Jesus Christ and His gospel.
Faith in Jesus Christ is a gift from God and comes through studying and living His word and His gospel.
The approved scriptures of the Church, also called the standard works, are the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.
We should study these sacred books, especially the Book of Mormon, daily.
The Book of Mormon testifies of Jesus Christ and the truthfulness of His doctrine.
