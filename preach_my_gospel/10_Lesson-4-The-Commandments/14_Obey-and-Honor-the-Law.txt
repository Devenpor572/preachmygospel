Obey and Honor the Law
Latter-day Saints everywhere believe in obeying the laws of the country in which they live.
Members of the Church are counseled to be good citizens, to participate in civil government and the political process, and to render community service.
They do so, however, as concerned citizens, not as representatives of the Church.
